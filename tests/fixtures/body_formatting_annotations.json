Blight</strong>: Your exhibition <em>Regarding Nature</em> is concerned with the interesting way in which photography documents ecological change, specifically with respect to Edward James Salisbury’s travels through Britain in the first half of the twentieth century, which you have responded to in your own contemporary work that retraces his footsteps. Focussing on Salisbury’s landscape images to begin with, how do these photographs speak of nature in a historical sense? How do you think Salisbury <em>regarded</em> nature, visually and conceptually?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chrystel Lebas</strong>: This is an interesting question about the act of looking for scientific purposes: what are we looking at? Is it of any importance? How does looking inform research? I concluded, during my research, that Salisbury photographed mainly for scientific purposes; he used his photographs as a document to illustrate his writings and records his experiments. The notebooks and papers archived at The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Library Art &amp; Archives (after he died someone donated them all to Kew) didn’t reveal anything from his photographic past and how he came to use the medium. I know that he was from a wealthy family of 9 children, and they all studied or worked in the Arts, Science or Architecture. I presume they had a darkroom in the house (in Harpenden), so I guess they must have picked up on the beginning of photography together, and Salisbury then carried on using it for his own research.</p>\n\n<p>Photography was used widely by ecologists at the beginning of the 20th century, often Salisbury’s contemporaries would use the newest processes such as cameras loaded with roll film, instead of glass plate negatives that they would previously have been familiar with. Francis Wall Oliver, botanist, and Salisbury’s professor and colleague at University College London, used a panorama box camera loaded with gelatin film and together with Salisbury they photographed and researched Blakeney in Norfolk. If Salisbury’s images are most of the time overexposed and don’t pay much attention to composition – “the view” – Oliver’s panoramas are well composed and exposed, showing a topographic view of the landscape. I also suspected that Salisbury used very old batches of glass plates, as I found some sort of pattern on the negatives whilst I was printing from them in my darkroom. So, in short, I think that Salisbury regarded nature as a scientist would, looking for clues and studying it to understand how plants grow in specific locations and in specific climate conditions. Observing the effects human beings have on ecology was his main focus.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/1_EJS_Shingle%20mobility%20between%20Suaeda%20bushes%2C%20Blakeney_237_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Edward James Salisbury.

What was your specific approach to making these?</p>\n\n<p><strong>CL</strong>: When I was introduced to the E.J. Salisbury collection at the Natural History Museum, I had no idea which direction I would take, what I would focus on, and it was only after discussing with Dr Mark Spencer, the botanist that worked at the Museum, that it made sense to try and travel to the places depicted in Salisbury’s photographs and maybe to re-photograph the locations. And of course the photographs I would take might show environmental change, because I would be walking in Salisbury’s footsteps some 90 years later… It wasn’t that easy at first, as the glass plates sometimes contained only a few elements to guide me through a location: the plant species, date and location names might just be readable from Salisbury’s handwriting, engraved or written directly on the glass plate.</p>\n\n<p>Arrochar, in Argyll, and Bute, Trossachs National Park, was the first area in Scotland I decided to focus on, then Rothiemurchus forest in the Cairnghorms, Culbin Sands near Inverness, Blakeney in Norfolk and Devon followed. Here the task of finding the place was made easier by the title I would find on the glass plate and container box. For example, Loch Long and Glen Loin were easy finds; the view shows the loch photographed at its head, the background showing a range of hills and the foreground populated by <em>Scirpus</em> [<em>Bolboschoenus</em>] <em>maritimus</em>, a plant that would be found especially in areas where salt water meets soft water coming down from the mountain. After photographing from a variety of angles, to find the exact view, I finally found the precise point and I observed that the plant species was no longer present in the landscape.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/2_EJS_Scirpus%20maritimus_1075_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Edward James Salisbury, from box 1075-1079-Arrochar 1928.

Observing and photographing from Salisbury’s viewpoint, looking towards the mountains in the background of his photograph for points of reference, my photographs record the same place in low and high tides. There is no vegetation in the foreground, only water from the Loch. To back up my find I interviewed Heather, a local who has lived in the</p>\n\n<p>village throughout her eighty-four years, who told me about changes that have occurred. She mentioned the reconstruction of the road and the Shire Bridge being moved closer to the Loch head, as well as the fact that a great abundance of detritus washes up on the shores of the Loch in bad weather. The council has started to clear up this detritus and as a result the flora has been uprooted and dragged away from the shores.</p>\n\n<p>Walking together with a scientist and discussing the photographs afterwards would inform the way I would eventually photograph, however resistant I would be sometimes to re-photograph a view – which wasn’t necessarily the one I would have agreed to focus on in the first instance. This sparked some discussions about “the view”, what is the “best view” or interpretation of the landscape – his or mine?</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the Salisbury photographs would be left aside and I would walk without having to constantly look for his views, but find my own. Looking at Salisbury’s views in the areas around the Rothiemurchus Estate, a privately owned Highland Estate within Strathspey, northeast of the river Spey, in the Cairngorms National Park, I discovered that this landscape was very different to the one captured in Arrochar. In comparison with Arrochar where the landscape is managed by farming and water or forest related activities, the landscape in Rothiemurchus has been left to its own agency, growing, falling apart and re-generating itself. I found the landscape barely changed since Salisbury photographed it in the 1930s.</p>\n\n<p>The first pairing of photographs in the series, <em>Re-visiting – Pinus silvestris [illeg.]</em>, was key to my collaboration with Dr Mark Spencer, senior botanist from the Natural History Museum in London. This pairing was made with Mark’s collaboration. My understanding of the landscape’s ecology that Salisbury photographed 90 years previously, was enhanced by his explanation. My photograph shows more trees than Salisbury’s black and white glass plate. Dr. Mark Spencer explained that these could have been growing throughout the last ninety years surrounding the older tree seen in the center of the image. Thus showing me that in order to understand the habitat one must understand its history.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/3_EJS_Pinus%20sylvestris%20at%20tree%20limit_1245_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Edward James Salisbury, from 1237-1249-Aviemore.

It just happened that I often found the places to photograph at the end of the day, making it appropriate for me to record the shifting time of day, bringing a layer of uncertainty to the image. I wonder what we will find in these places in 100 years’ time?</p>\n\n<p><strong>DCB</strong>: And so from your detailed research and the various processes you have undertaken while travelling to make this work, your own artistic project has very much emerged, which both reveals a sense of history hidden in the landscape, but also interestingly – as is stated in the press release for the show – the psychological effects of the landscape. Can you elaborate on these things?</p>\n\n<p><strong>CL</strong>: I have always been interested in the fact that photography might just reveal what the eye cannot see, with long exposures for example, hence bringing another layer of understanding to the image. For this particular series it was important to take the viewer with me through these walks, these wanderings, through changing landscapes, and share the experience of looking at the places through Salisbury’s eyes and through my own. The psychological effect is very much translated through the way I photograph and the way that you, the viewer, might comprehend the image depends on your own experience of the landscape. For me it all takes me back to my own childhood spent roaming the forests in the South of France and Burgundy where I grew up, playing in the wild landscapes being scared sometimes and attracted to these intriguing spaces at the same time. Learning about the ecology through “<em>Histoire Naturelles</em>” at school, was a key component of my interest in the natural world. Here, of course, this psychological element is emphasised by the fact that these habitats are, have been or will be, in some way influenced by man, animal and the climate – the ecological identity of the places. There is also the physicality of the images, in the exhibition or in my publication <em>Field Studies</em>, printed in large scale for the viewer to be drawn into the space of the image, into the landscape’s histories, where notions of the sublime and our relationship to nature come into play.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/ChrystelLebas_FieldStudies01.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chrystel Lebas, Field Studies, Fw: Books, 2017\"><figcaption>\n  <p>Chrystel Lebas, <em>Field Studies</em>, Fw: Books, 2017</p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><strong>DCB</strong>: Your new monograph <em>Field Studies: Walking Through Landscapes and Archives</em>, is a beautiful realisation of the project in book form. What is the concept behind the book, and how did you come to produce the project in this way?</p>\n\n<p><strong>CL</strong>: It was important for me to bring together Salisbury’s archive, and my own interpretation of his research in film and photography, and also to use the key texts that I researched throughout the years. For example each group of images is accompanied by 2 extracted texts/quotes, one from Clive A. Stace’s 2014 <em>New Flora of the British Isles</em>, which is the botanists’ bible, which I have seen being used whilst researching at the Natural History Museum by botanists working there to be able to identify plant species in a precise and scientific way. The texts are hermetic to me and most of the time incomprehensible. And in parallel I extracted quotes and passages of texts from Salisbury’s own publications, which are written in a more poetic, reader friendly way.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/5_CL_Re-visiting%20Colonisation%20of%20boulder%20by%20Mosses%20%26%20Oxalis%20acetosella_Plate%20n%C2%B01254_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chrystel Lebas, Re-visiting Colonisation of boulder by Mosses &amp; Oxalis acetosella.Plate n°1254, Arrochar, May 2012. 56°13.041’ N 4°44.146’ W\"><figcaption>\n  <p>Chrystel Lebas, <em>Re-visiting</em> <em>Colonisation of boulder by Mosses &amp; Oxalis acetosella.</em>Plate n°1254, Arrochar, May 2012. 56°13.041’ N 4°44.146’ W</p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>For example, in <em>Re-visiting Colonisation of boulder by Mosses &amp; Oxalis acetosella</em>, Plate n°1254, Arrochar, May 2012, Salisbury’s text explains: ‘A common example of sleep-movements is furnished by the Wood Sorrel in which the leaflets droop down at night (Fig. 173). Such movements can also be induced by the influence of contact. Thus, if the leaflets of the Wood Sorrel are repeatedly flicked with the finger, they will after some time assume the night position (Fig. 173, N). Other kinds of Wood Sorrel which are cultivated in conservatories display these changes much more rapidly.’ In this passage Salisbury “humanizes” the plant species and bring us close to the natural world. These extracted texts are also exhibited with the photographs.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/5_EJS_Colonisation%20of%20boulder%20by%20mosses%20%20%26%20Oxalis%20acetocella.%20E.J.S.%201928_1254_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Edward James Salisbury, from box 1250-1258-Arrochar 1928.

Salisbury’s publication <em>Weeds and Aliens</em>, explains the complexities around weeds growing in our gardens that we don’t necessarily want, and plants that were imported to embellish our gardens during the Victorian period that are preventing the native species growing. Here I have chosen to use the similar method of creating Plant Portraits in my colour darkroom, placing the plant directly on to the photographic paper and changing the colour filtration gradually to record the chromatic effect.  Here this series shows my own interpretation of a scientific recording. As Salisbury recorded in his notebooks his own experiments, I recorded mine.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/6a_Buddleia%20Davidii_1_130M0C30s.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Plant Portraits or Weeds &amp; Aliens Studies, Buddleja davidii, Butterfly-bush, 0 yellow 130 magenta 0 cyan 30 secs, Photogram, 2016\"><figcaption>\n  <p><em>Plant Portraits or Weeds &amp; Aliens Studies, Buddleja davidii</em>, Butterfly-bush, 0 yellow 130 magenta 0 cyan 30 secs, Photogram, 2016</p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/6b_Buddleia%20Davidii_12_100Y100M30s.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Plant Portraits or Weeds &amp; Aliens Studies, Buddleja davidii, Butterfly-bush, 100 yellow, 100 magenta, 0 cyan, 30 secs, Photogram, 2016\"><figcaption>\n  <p><em>Plant Portraits or Weeds &amp; Aliens Studies, Buddleja davidii</em>, Butterfly-bush, 100 yellow, 100 magenta, 0 cyan, 30 secs, Photogram, 2016</p>\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Then of course Nanda van den Berg, the director of Huis Marseille Photography Museum where I had the first showing of “Regarding Nature”, and for which the book was published, wanted to write an interview “Vogue style”, that would retrace my practice and its beginnings from childhood to now, something I have never done before and was a very interesting venture. From five hours of telephone conversation Nanda managed to beautifully write an essay that brings together the core of my practice as an artist. Making me realise that my past might just have influenced my practice in some ways more than I anticipated.</p>\n\n<p>I also asked Dr. Mark Spencer to write an essay on the collections and the role of the archive, and especially the photographic archive in the Natural History Museum. Mark also gave an account of his own experience working in collaboration with artists, which could be an interesting or challenging task at times, and as an expert in his field of Botany he was able to give us more understanding of the role of science in understanding the environmental issues we deal with currently. Bergit Arends was the curator for the project; her essay is centered on the role of the artist and scientists working in collaboration and especially retracing the steps of the project, from the beginning, creating an interesting dialogue between art and science.</p>\n\n<p>Liz Wells has known my work for a long time, writing and curating it, she is also a great figure in terms of contemporary photography that focuses on the environment and issues relating to it. Her essay brings in parallel, past bodies of work that relate to similar issues and replaces them in the context of my practice and current practices in contemporary landscape photography.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DCB</strong>: What challenges does the environment face today? And how might photography contribute to our understanding of the ecological issues we face on a planetary scale?</p>\n\n<p><strong>CL</strong>: This is an important question and one that I will be cautious in answering, and I will let Dr Mark Spencer explain as he did in his essay in <em>Field Studies</em>: ‘Conveying the impacts of environmental change on the living world (or ‘biodiversity’ in current parlance) to non-specialists is challenging. People find it hard to comprehend complex atmospheric processes when it comes to understanding climate change. This complexity is exacerbated in the living world; not only are biological processes highly complex, they are (compared to climatological processes relating to climate change) poorly documented and under-researched. To us biologists, this lack of knowledge is deeply concerning; the “passive green backdrop” that us humans take for granted is the very stuff of life. Environmental change effects all vegetation types, cultivated, human-impacted lands and our rapidly diminishing wildernesses, and this will have an enormous impact on our own well-being. An accessible way of imparting the importance of environmental change is via photography. One of the most regular and successful means by which scientists demonstrate climate change is by the use of photographs of ice-sheets or glaciers: an “historic” image denoting past conditions and recent photography that underlines the extent of the change.’</p>\n\n<p>My work is increasingly focusing on these particular issues around the environment and how we, human beings, influence it, however sometimes it is more complex then it appears and that is why we need science to step in and demonstrate the urgencies we face. In my photography and film works I am pointing out at the issues, hopefully engaging with a wider audience to share my findings and at the same time asking questions that might just provoke a reaction or a dialogue. My photographs are accompanied with GPS coordinates so that the locations can be retraced back and observed years after my photographs and Salisbury’s were taken, hence the recording of potential change in the landscape will continue.</p>\n\n</article>",

What was your specific approach to making these?</p>\n<p><strong>CL</strong>: When I was introduced to the E.J. Salisbury collection at the Natural History Museum, I had no idea which direction I would take, what I would focus on, and it was only after discussing with Dr Mark Spencer, the botanist that worked at the Museum, that it made sense to try and travel to the places depicted in Salisbury’s photographs and maybe to re-photograph the locations. And of course the photographs I would take might show environmental change, because I would be walking in Salisbury’s footsteps some 90 years later… It wasn’t that easy at first, as the glass plates sometimes contained only a few elements to guide me through a location: the plant species, date and location names might just be readable from Salisbury’s handwriting, engraved or written directly on the glass plate.</p>\n<p>Arrochar, in Argyll, and Bute, Trossachs National Park, was the first area in Scotland I decided to focus on, then Rothiemurchus forest in the Cairnghorms, Culbin Sands near Inverness, Blakeney in Norfolk and Devon followed. Here the task of finding the place was made easier by the title I would find on the glass plate and container box. For example, Loch Long and Glen Loin were easy finds; the view shows the loch photographed at its head, the background showing a range of hills and the foreground populated by <em>Scirpus</em> [<em>Bolboschoenus</em>] <em>maritimus</em>, a plant that would be found especially in areas where salt water meets soft water coming down from the mountain. After photographing from a variety of angles, to find the exact view, I finally found the precise point and I observed that the plant species was no longer present in the landscape.</p>\n</div></div></div>  </div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</div><div class=\"field-item odd\"><div about=\"\" typeof=\"\" class=\"entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-reading-width-image-caption view-mode-full tpg_global_paragraphs_margin_before_0 tpg_global_paragraphs_margin_after_24 clearfix\">\n\n  \n  \n  <div class=\"ds-center\">\n    <div class=\"field field-name-field-reading-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/2_EJS_Scirpus%20maritimus_1075_medium.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\" alt=\"\" title=\"Edward James Salisbury, from box 1075-1079-Arrochar 1928.

Observing and photographing from Salisbury’s viewpoint, looking towards the mountains in the background of his photograph for points of reference, my photographs record the same place in low and high tides. There is no vegetation in the foreground, only water from the Loch. To back up my find I interviewed Heather, a local who has lived in the</p>\n<p>village throughout her eighty-four years, who told me about changes that have occurred. She mentioned the reconstruction of the road and the Shire Bridge being moved closer to the Loch head, as well as the fact that a great abundance of detritus washes up on the shores of the Loch in bad weather. The council has started to clear up this detritus and as a result the flora has been uprooted and dragged away from the shores.</p>\n<p>Walking together with a scientist and discussing the photographs afterwards would inform the way I would eventually photograph, however resistant I would be sometimes to re-photograph a view – which wasn’t necessarily the one I would have agreed to focus on in the first instance. This sparked some discussions about “the view”, what is the “best view” or interpretation of the landscape – his or mine?</p>\n<p>Sometimes the Salisbury photographs would be left aside and I would walk without having to constantly look for his views, but find my own. Looking at Salisbury’s views in the areas around the Rothiemurchus Estate, a privately owned Highland Estate within Strathspey, northeast of the river Spey, in the Cairngorms National Park, I discovered that this landscape was very different to the one captured in Arrochar. In comparison with Arrochar where the landscape is managed by farming and water or forest related activities, the landscape in Rothiemurchus has been left to its own agency, growing, falling apart and re-generating itself. I found the landscape barely changed since Salisbury photographed it in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>The first pairing of photographs in the series, <em>Re-visiting – Pinus silvestris [illeg.]</em>, was key to my collaboration with Dr Mark Spencer, senior botanist from the Natural History Museum in London. This pairing was made with Mark’s collaboration. My understanding of the landscape’s ecology that Salisbury photographed 90 years previously, was enhanced by his explanation. My photograph shows more trees than Salisbury’s black and white glass plate. Dr. Mark Spencer explained that these could have been growing throughout the last ninety years surrounding the older tree seen in the center of the image. Thus showing me that in order to understand the habitat one must understand its history.</p>\n</div></div></div>  </div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</div><div class=\"field-item even\"><div about=\"\" typeof=\"\" class=\"entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-reading-width-image-caption view-mode-full tpg_global_paragraphs_margin_before_0 tpg_global_paragraphs_margin_after_24 clearfix\">\n\n  \n  \n  <div class=\"ds-center\">\n    <div class=\"field field-name-field-reading-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/3_EJS_Pinus%20sylvestris%20at%20tree%20limit_1245_medium.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"757\" alt=\"\" title=\"Edward James Salisbury, from 1237-1249-Aviemore.

It just happened that I often found the places to photograph at the end of the day, making it appropriate for me to record the shifting time of day, bringing a layer of uncertainty to the image. I wonder what we will find in these places in 100 years’ time?</p>\n<p><strong>DCB</strong>: And so from your detailed research and the various processes you have undertaken while travelling to make this work, your own artistic project has very much emerged, which both reveals a sense of history hidden in the landscape, but also interestingly – as is stated in the press release for the show – the psychological effects of the landscape. Can you elaborate on these things?</p>\n<p><strong>CL</strong>: I have always been interested in the fact that photography might just reveal what the eye cannot see, with long exposures for example, hence bringing another layer of understanding to the image. For this particular series it was important to take the viewer with me through these walks, these wanderings, through changing landscapes, and share the experience of looking at the places through Salisbury’s eyes and through my own. The psychological effect is very much translated through the way I photograph and the way that you, the viewer, might comprehend the image depends on your own experience of the landscape. For me it all takes me back to my own childhood spent roaming the forests in the South of France and Burgundy where I grew up, playing in the wild landscapes being scared sometimes and attracted to these intriguing spaces at the same time. Learning about the ecology through “<em>Histoire Naturelles</em>” at school, was a key component of my interest in the natural world. Here, of course, this psychological element is emphasised by the fact that these habitats are, have been or will be, in some way influenced by man, animal and the climate – the ecological identity of the places. There is also the physicality of the images, in the exhibition or in my publication <em>Field Studies</em>, printed in large scale for the viewer to be drawn into the space of the image, into the landscape’s histories, where notions of the sublime and our relationship to nature come into play.</p>\n</div></div></div>  </div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</div><div class=\"field-item odd\"><div about=\"\" typeof=\"\" class=\"entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-reading-width-image-caption view-mode-full tpg_global_paragraphs_margin_before_0 tpg_global_paragraphs_margin_after_24 clearfix\">\n\n  \n  \n  <div class=\"ds-center\">\n    <div class=\"field field-name-field-reading-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/sites/default/files/ChrystelLebas_FieldStudies01.jpg\" width=\"1036\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chrystel Lebas, Field Studies, Fw: Books, 2017\"><figcaption><blockquote class=\"image-field-caption\">\n  <p>Chrystel Lebas, <em>Field Studies</em>, Fw: Books, 2017</p>\n</blockquote></figcaption>\n</div></div></div>  </div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</div><div class=\"field-item even\"><div about=\"\" typeof=\"\" class=\"entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-text-reading-width view-mode-full tpg_global_paragraphs_margin_before_0 tpg_global_paragraphs_margin_after_24 clearfix\">\n\n  \n  \n  <div class=\"ds-center\">\n    <div class=\"field field-name-field-paragraph-description field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p><strong>DCB</strong>: Your new monograph <em>Field Studies: Walking Through Landscapes and Archives</em>, is a beautiful realisation of the project in book form.

For example each group of images is accompanied by 2 extracted texts/quotes, one from Clive A. Stace’s 2014 <em>New Flora of the British Isles</em>, which is the botanists’ bible, which I have seen being used whilst researching at the Natural History Museum by botanists working there to be able to identify plant species in a precise and scientific way. The texts are hermetic to me and most of the time incomprehensible.

Such movements can also be induced by the influence of contact. Thus, if the leaflets of the Wood Sorrel are repeatedly flicked with the finger, they will after some time assume the night position (Fig. 173, N). Other kinds of Wood Sorrel which are cultivated in conservatories display these changes much more rapidly.’ In this passage Salisbury “humanizes” the plant species and bring us close to the natural world.

And how might photography contribute to our understanding of the ecological issues we face on a planetary scale?</p>\n<p><strong>CL</strong>: This is an important question and one that I will be cautious in answering, and I will let Dr Mark Spencer explain as he did in his essay in <em>Field Studies</em>: ‘Conveying the impacts of environmental change on the living world (or ‘biodiversity’ in current parlance) to non-specialists is challenging. People find it hard to comprehend complex atmospheric processes when it comes to understanding climate change. This complexity is exacerbated in the living world; not only are biological processes highly complex, they are (compared to climatological processes relating to climate change) poorly documented and under-researched. To us biologists, this lack of knowledge is deeply concerning; the “passive green backdrop” that us humans take for granted is the very stuff of life. Environmental change effects all vegetation types, cultivated, human-impacted lands and our rapidly diminishing wildernesses, and this will have an enormous impact on our own well-being. An accessible way of imparting the importance of environmental change is via photography. One of the most regular and successful means by which scientists demonstrate climate change is by the use of photographs of ice-sheets or glaciers: an “historic” image denoting past conditions and recent photography that underlines the extent of the change.’</p>\n<p>My work is increasingly focusing on these particular issues around the environment and how we, human beings, influence it, however sometimes it is more complex then it appears and that is why we need science to step in and demonstrate the urgencies we face. In my photography and film works I am pointing out at the issues, hopefully engaging with a wider audience to share my findings and at the same time asking questions that might just provoke a reaction or a dialogue. My photographs are accompanied with GPS coordinates so that the locations can be retraced back and observed years after my photographs and Salisbury’s were taken, hence the recording of potential change in the landscape will continue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n</div></div></div>  </div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n</div></div></div></div>",

        "expected_html": "<article>\n\n<p>On Halloween in 2008, about six weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed, my mother called from Michigan to tell me that my father had lost his job in the sales department of Visteon, an auto parts supplier for Ford. Two months later, my mother lost her own job working for the city of Troy, a suburb about half an hour from Detroit. From there, our lives seemed to accelerate, the terrible events compounding fast enough to elude ­immediate understanding. By June, my parents, unable to find any work in the state where they spent their entire lives, moved to New York, where my sister and I were both in school. A month later, the mortgage on my childhood home went into default for lack of payment.</p>\n\n<p>After several months of unemployment, my mother got a job in New York City fundraising for a children’s choir. In the summer of 2010, I completed school at New York University, where I received a B.A. and an M.A. in English literature, with more than $100,000 of debt, for which my father was a cosigner. By this time, my father was still unemployed, and my mother had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She continued working, though her employer was clearly perturbed that she’d have to take off every Friday for chemotherapy. To compensate for the lost time, on Mondays she rode early buses into the city from the Bronx, where, after months of harrowing uncertainty, my parents had settled. She wanted to be in the office first thing.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2011, Chase Bank took full possession of the house in Michigan. Our last ties were severed by an email my father received from the realtor, who had tried and failed to short sell the property, telling him “it’s safe to turn off the utilities.” In May, I got a freelance contract with a newspaper that within a year would hire me full-time — paying me, after taxes, roughly $900 every two weeks. In September 2011, my parents were approved for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and in October, due to a paperwork snafu, their car was repossessed in the middle of the night by creditors. Meanwhile, the payments for my debt — which had been borrowed from a variety of federal and private lenders, most prominently Citibank — totaled about $1,100 a month.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I would look at the number on my paycheck and obsessively subtract my rent, the cost of a carton of eggs and a can of beans, and the price of a loan payment.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Now 30 years old, I have been incapacitated by debt for a decade. The delicate balancing act my family and I perform in order to make a payment each month has become the organizing principle of our lives. To this end, I am just one of about 44 million borrowers in the United States who owe a total of roughly $1.4 trillion in student loan debt. This number is almost incomprehensibly high, and yet it continues to increase with no sign of stopping. Reform legislation that might help families in financial hardship has failed in Congress. A bill introduced in May 2017, the Discharge Student Loans in Bankruptcy Act, which would undo changes made to the bankruptcy code in the early 2000s, stalled in committee. Despite all evidence that student loan debt is a national crisis, the majority of the U.S. government — the only party with the power to resolve the problem — refuses to acknowledge its severity.</p>\n\n<p>My debt was the result, in equal measure, of a chain of rotten luck and a system that is an abject failure by design. My parents never lived extravagantly. In the first years of their marriage, my father drove a cab. When they had children and my father started a career in the auto industry, we became firmly middle class. Still, there was usually just enough money to cover the bills — car leases, a mortgage, groceries. My sister and I both attended public school. How much things cost was a constant discussion. Freshman year of high school, when I lost my yearbook, which cost $40, my mother very nearly wept. College, which cost roughly $50,000 a year, was the only time that money did not seem to matter. “We’ll find a way to pay for it,” my parents said repeatedly. And if we couldn’t pay for it immediately, there was always a bank somewhere willing to give us a loan. This was true even after my parents had both lost their jobs amidst a global financial meltdown. Like many well-meaning but misguided baby boomers, neither of my parents received an elite education, but they nevertheless believed that an expensive school was the key to a better life than the one they’d had. They continued to put faith in this falsehood, and so we continued spending money that we didn’t have — money that banks kept giving to us.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve spent a great deal of time in the last decade shifting the blame for my debt. Whose fault was it? My devoted parents, for encouraging me to attend a school they couldn’t afford? The banks, which should never have lent money to people who clearly couldn’t pay it back, continuously exploiting the hope of families like mine, and quick to exploit us further once that hope disappeared? Or was it my fault for not having the foresight to realize it was a mistake to spend roughly $200,000 on a school where, in order to get my degree, I kept a journal about reading Virginia Woolf? The problem, I think, runs deeper than blame. The foundational myth of an entire generation of Americans was the false promise that education was priceless — that its value was above or beyond its cost.</p>\n\n<p>After the dust settled on the collapse of the economy, we found ourselves in an impossible situation: We owed more each month than we could collectively pay. And so we wrote letters to Citibank’s mysterious P.O. box address in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, begging for help, letters that I doubt ever met a human being. The letters began to comprise a diary for my father in particular, a way to communicate a private anguish that he mostly bottled up. In one letter, addressed “Dear Citi,” he pleaded for a longer-term plan with lower monthly payments. He described how my mother’s mounting medical bills, as well as Chase Bank’s collection on our foreclosed home, had forced the family into bankruptcy, which provided no protection in the case of private student loans. We were not asking, in the end, for relief or forgiveness, but merely to pay them an amount we could still barely afford. “This is an appeal to Citi asking you to work with us on this loan,” he wrote to no one at all.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, at the beginning of 2012, my father started writing to the office of Congressman Joseph Crowley, who represented the district in the Bronx where my parents had relocated. My father described himself and my mother to Crowley as “the poster children for this entire financial event,” by which he meant Americans who seemed to have done everything right on paper, but in doing so contributed to their own downfall. By the time he wrote to Crowley, my father was working again, but it had taken him two years to find another job for much less money. After his run of financial calamity, he knew better than to believe anything good would last. “We are in our 60s and I figure when we get to our mid-70s, life will become difficult again,” he wrote.</p>\n\n<figure><img data-attachment-id=\"1025718\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2018/01/middle-class-meltdown/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"400,400\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;(Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage-400x400.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage.jpg\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage.jpg\" alt=\"A homeowner watches in horror as a house resting on a stack of gold coins topples over him, signifying how the recession affected mortgages.\" srcset=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage.jpg 400w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage-175x175.jpg 175w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"><figcaption>(Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Crowley’s office wrote back. It was the first time in about two years that a person had responded to our correspondence with encouragement, or something like it. Kevin Casey, who worked for Crowley in Washington, helped arrange a conference call with government liaisons from Citigroup to discuss a different payment plan. The terms were reasonable enough, but the response was like an automated message brought to life: “We are precluded from a regulatory perspective from being able to do what you are asking,” each of the representatives said. What made these exchanges more ridiculous was the fact that Citibank was in the process of retreating from the student loan market by selling off my debt to Discover Financial, who would give us the same response. We were nothing to these companies but a number in a database.</p>\n\n<p>I used to wonder what the people who worked for these lenders would do if their own children had to take out loans to pay for college. After 10 years, I have come to think of my debt as being like an alcoholic relative who shows up to ruin happy occasions. But when I first got out of school and the reality of how much money I owed finally struck me, the debt was more of a constant and explicit preoccupation, a matter of life and death.</p>\n\n<p>I had studied English because I wanted to be a writer. I never had an expectation of becoming rich. My M.A. fed an intellectual curiosity that eventually led me to newspapers. I understand now the extent to which I was among the most overeducated group of young adults in human history. Once I could no longer delay and the payments began, I would look at the number on my paycheck and obsessively subtract my rent, the cost of a carton of eggs and a can of beans (my sustenance during the first lean year of this mess), and the price of a loan payment. The question was: What will you do when the money from the paycheck is gone?</p>\n\n<p>I never arrived at an answer to this question. At my lowest points, I began fantasizing about dying, not because I was suicidal, but because death would have meant relief from having to come up with an answer. The debt was mind-controlling — how I would eat or pay my rent without defaulting was a constant refrain, and I had long since abandoned any hope for a future in which I had a meaningful line of credit or a disposable income or even simply owned something — but also mind-numbingly banal. I spent a great deal of time filling out paperwork over and over again with my personal information and waiting on hold for extended periods in order to speak to a robotic voice rejecting my request.</p>\n\n<p>And so it felt good to think about dying, in the way that it felt good to take a long nap in order to not be conscious for a while. These thoughts culminated in November 2010, when I met with my father one afternoon to retrieve more paperwork. My hope for some forgiving demise had resulted in my being viciously sick with strep throat. I refused to go to the doctor in the hope that my condition might worsen into a more serious infection that, even if it didn’t kill me, might force someone to at last lavish me with pity. I coughed up a not insignificant portion of ­yellowish fluid, and I started the conversation by asking, “Theoretically, if I were to, say, kill myself, what would happen to the debt?”</p>\n\n<p>“I would have to pay it myself,” my father said. He paused and then offered me a melancholy smile. “Listen, it’s just debt,” he said. “No one is dying from this.”</p>\n\n<p>My father had suffered in the previous two years. In a matter of months, he had lost everything he had worked most of his adult life to achieve — first his career, then his home, then his dignity.

A $25,000 loan at 7.5 percent interest, to which my family and I had contributed, over the course of three years, $12,531.12 and on which I now owed $25,933.66 — more than what I started out with. I memorized — or, more often, didn’t — seemingly crucial details about my debt that turned out to be comically meaningless: a low-interest loan from Perkins was serviced by a company called ACS, which had rebranded to Conduent Education and sent out notices with their new logo and the message “Soon to be Conduent.” Citibank, referring to itself as “Citibank, N.A. (Citibank),” transferred the servicing of my loans to Firstmark, and I had to create an account with Firstmark. Sallie Mae’s lending arm spun off into an independent company called Navient, which became the country’s largest supplier of private student loans, and eventually sold a portion of my debt to a lender called Great Lakes. In 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued Navient for deliberately creating problems for borrowers trying to pay off a loan by supplying them with faulty information — for instance, according to the litigation, encouraging borrowers to enter payment plans that temporarily postponed bills instead of enrolling them in repayment plans that promised forgiveness after years of steady payment. This lawsuit seemed bathed in significance, but of course resulted in nothing at all, save for a widely circulated public statement from Navient claiming, “There is no expectation that the servicer will act in the interest of the consumer.” When I received a notice from Navient in February 2017 that my monthly payments would be increasing, for reasons I did not comprehend, the email came with a note at the bottom saying, “We’re here to help: We’re happy to help you navigate your options, provide you with resources, and answer any questions you have as you repay your loans.” The company’s motto is, hilariously, “Solutions for your success.”</p>\n\n<figure><img data-attachment-id=\"1025719\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2018/01/middle-class-meltdown/2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"400,400\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;(Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate-400x400.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate.jpg\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate.jpg\" alt=\"A college graduate whose mortarboard carries a price tag.\" srcset=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate.jpg 400w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate-175x175.jpg 175w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-college-loan-graduate-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"><figcaption>(Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>These announcements flooded my inbox with the subject line “Important Information,” but none of them altered my fate. Sometimes the monthly payments would go up, sometimes my salary would go up, sometimes I made a check out to a different company. The only stable thing was the money I owed, which never seemed to get any lower. My mother’s cancer went into remission, and both of my parents found, in their 60s, new careers. I maintained steady employment in journalism since finishing school, and in 2016 I was hired as an editor at <em>The New York Times</em>. Was it possible we had become lucky?</p>\n\n<p>It was in the summer of 2017, after my father, now nearing 70, had lost another job, that I finally removed him as a cosigner and refinanced my loans with one of the few companies that provides such a service, SoFi. My wife would help with the payments when she could. Sharing the burden of my debt with my spouse instead of my parents was a small, depressing victory, a milestone perhaps unique to members of my generation.</p>\n\n<p>SoFi has not made my situation much more tenable, necessarily. The main differences are that I now write one check instead of several, and that I have an end date for when the debt, including the calculated interest — about $182,000 — will be paid off: 2032, when I’ll be 44. What I have to pay each month is still, for the most part, more than I am able to afford. I rely on the help of people I love and live by each paycheck. I still harbor anxiety about the bad things that could befall me should the paycheck disappear.</p>\n\n<p>But the so-called Important Information I receive has changed. SoFi, which bills itself as a “modern finance company” (its name is shorthand for Social Finance, Inc.), is a Silicon Valley startup that offers, in addition to loans, membership outreach in the form of financial literacy workshops and free dinners. Their aim is to “empower our members,” a mission that was called into question by the resignation, in September 2017, of its CEO, who employees allege had engaged in serial workplace sexual harassment and who ran the office, according to a <em>New York Times</em> headline, like “a frat house.” The news came out not long after I refinanced my loans with the company — I became, I suppose, a SoFi’er, in the company’s parlance. Around this same time, I started receiving curious emails from them: “Dear NYC SoFi’er,” one of these emails read. “Grab a single friend and join us for a fun night at Rare View Rooftop Bar and Lounge in Murray Hill! You’ll mingle with some of our most interesting (and available!) members …” The invitation cited a statistic that promised “86 percent of members at other SoFi Singles events said they met someone they want to see again.”</p>\n\n<p>I am a 30-year-old married man with more than $100,000 of debt, who makes less each year than what he owes. Buying a pair of pants is a major financial decision for me. I do not think myself “eligible” in any sense of the word. Still, I felt as if in 10 years, the debt hadn’t changed, but the world had, or at least the world’s view of it. This thing, this 21st-century blight, was now so normal — so basic — that it had been co-opted by the wellness industry of Silicon Valley. My debt was now approachable, a way to meet people. It was, in other words, an investment in my future, which is why I had gone into debt in the first place. Would SoFi be this friendly if I lost my job and missed a monthly payment?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say I was morbidly intrigued. The day after Valentine’s Day, I went to a Mexican restaurant for a SoFi community dinner — this was not a single’s event, but simply a free meal. SoFi had rented out the back room, where a few dozen people had gathered, all wearing name tags and discussing financial woes. Sid, a software developer who had racked up credit card debt after college, told me that the debt was a unifying force at these gatherings. “When there’s a break in the conversation, someone can just say, ‘So, debt, huh?’ and things will get going again,” he said. “If we walked outside of this room,” he continued, gesturing to the suits by the bar, “everyone out there would have debt, too. It’s just a little more out in the open for us.”</p>\n\n<p>Despite the name tags, the dinner turned out to resemble something more like an AA meeting, an earnest session of group therapy. Everyone had their story about the problems caused by their student loans and how they were trying, one day at a time, to improve things, and no story was exceptional, including my own. Ian, an employee for Google who had recently successfully paid off his debt from a Columbia MBA program, said he had a few “bone dry” years, where he lived on instant noodles. I told him I had a long way to go. “At least you’re doing something about it,” he said, sincerely.</p>\n\n<p>We sat down to dinner. Across from me was Mira, a defense attorney who attended law school at Stanford. Her payments amount to $2,300 a month, more than double my own. When I asked her why she came to this event, she glanced at me as if the answer should have been obvious: She went to law school at Stanford, and her payments are $2,300 a month. After the food was served, a waiter came by with a stack of to-go boxes. The group was reluctant at first, but then Ian said, “The chicken was actually pretty good,” as he scooped it into one of the boxes. Mira shrugged, took a fork, and added, “This is a little tacky, but I’d hate to waste free food,” and the rest of the table followed her lead. Maybe the next generation will do better, but I felt like we were broke and broken. No number of degrees or professional successes would put us back together again. For now, though, we knew where our next meal was coming from.</p>\n\n<p><em>M.H. Miller is the arts editor for </em>T: The New York Times Style Magazine<em>.</em></p>\n\n</article>",
        "raw_html": "<div class=\"post-body [-locked]\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n<p>On Halloween in 2008, about six weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed, my mother called from Michigan to tell me that my father had lost his job in the sales department of Visteon, an auto parts supplier for Ford. Two months later, my mother lost her own job working for the city of Troy, a suburb about half an hour from Detroit. From there, our lives seemed to accelerate, the terrible events compounding fast enough to elude ­immediate understanding. By June, my parents, unable to find any work in the state where they spent their entire lives, moved to New York, where my sister and I were both in school. A month later, the mortgage on my childhood home went into default for lack of payment.</p>\n<p>After several months of unemployment, my mother got a job in New York City fundraising for a children’s choir. In the summer of 2010, I completed school at New York University, where I received a B.A. and an M.A. in English literature, with more than $100,000 of debt, for which my father was a cosigner. By this time, my father was still unemployed, and my mother had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She continued working, though her employer was clearly perturbed that she’d have to take off every Friday for chemotherapy. To compensate for the lost time, on Mondays she rode early buses into the city from the Bronx, where, after months of harrowing uncertainty, my parents had settled. She wanted to be in the office first thing.</p>\n<p>In January 2011, Chase Bank took full possession of the house in Michigan. Our last ties were severed by an email my father received from the realtor, who had tried and failed to short sell the property, telling him “it’s safe to turn off the utilities.” In May, I got a freelance contract with a newspaper that within a year would hire me full-time — paying me, after taxes, roughly $900 every two weeks. In September 2011, my parents were approved for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and in October, due to a paperwork snafu, their car was repossessed in the middle of the night by creditors. Meanwhile, the payments for my debt — which had been borrowed from a variety of federal and private lenders, most prominently Citibank — totaled about $1,100 a month.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\"><p>I would look at the number on my paycheck and obsessively subtract my rent, the cost of a carton of eggs and a can of beans, and the price of a loan payment.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now 30 years old, I have been incapacitated by debt for a decade. The delicate balancing act my family and I perform in order to make a payment each month has become the organizing principle of our lives. To this end, I am just one of about 44 million borrowers in the United States who owe a total of roughly $1.4 trillion in student loan debt. This number is almost incomprehensibly high, and yet it continues to increase with no sign of stopping. Reform legislation that might help families in financial hardship has failed in Congress. A bill introduced in May 2017, the Discharge Student Loans in Bankruptcy Act, which would undo changes made to the bankruptcy code in the early 2000s, stalled in committee. Despite all evidence that student loan debt is a national crisis, the majority of the U.S. government — the only party with the power to resolve the problem — refuses to acknowledge its severity.</p>\n<p>My debt was the result, in equal measure, of a chain of rotten luck and a system that is an abject failure by design. My parents never lived extravagantly. In the first years of their marriage, my father drove a cab. When they had children and my father started a career in the auto industry, we became firmly middle class. Still, there was usually just enough money to cover the bills — car leases, a mortgage, groceries. My sister and I both attended public school. How much things cost was a constant discussion. Freshman year of high school, when I lost my yearbook, which cost $40, my mother very nearly wept. College, which cost roughly $50,000 a year, was the only time that money did not seem to matter. “We’ll find a way to pay for it,” my parents said repeatedly. And if we couldn’t pay for it immediately, there was always a bank somewhere willing to give us a loan. This was true even after my parents had both lost their jobs amidst a global financial meltdown. Like many well-meaning but misguided baby boomers, neither of my parents received an elite education, but they nevertheless believed that an expensive school was the key to a better life than the one they’d had. They continued to put faith in this falsehood, and so we continued spending money that we didn’t have — money that banks kept giving to us.</p>\n<p>I’ve spent a great deal of time in the last decade shifting the blame for my debt. Whose fault was it? My devoted parents, for encouraging me to attend a school they couldn’t afford? The banks, which should never have lent money to people who clearly couldn’t pay it back, continuously exploiting the hope of families like mine, and quick to exploit us further once that hope disappeared? Or was it my fault for not having the foresight to realize it was a mistake to spend roughly $200,000 on a school where, in order to get my degree, I kept a journal about reading Virginia Woolf? The problem, I think, runs deeper than blame. The foundational myth of an entire generation of Americans was the false promise that education was priceless — that its value was above or beyond its cost.</p>\n<p>After the dust settled on the collapse of the economy, we found ourselves in an impossible situation: We owed more each month than we could collectively pay. And so we wrote letters to Citibank’s mysterious P.O. box address in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, begging for help, letters that I doubt ever met a human being. The letters began to comprise a diary for my father in particular, a way to communicate a private anguish that he mostly bottled up. In one letter, addressed “Dear Citi,” he pleaded for a longer-term plan with lower monthly payments. He described how my mother’s mounting medical bills, as well as Chase Bank’s collection on our foreclosed home, had forced the family into bankruptcy, which provided no protection in the case of private student loans. We were not asking, in the end, for relief or forgiveness, but merely to pay them an amount we could still barely afford. “This is an appeal to Citi asking you to work with us on this loan,” he wrote to no one at all.</p>\n<p>Finally, at the beginning of 2012, my father started writing to the office of Congressman Joseph Crowley, who represented the district in the Bronx where my parents had relocated. My father described himself and my mother to Crowley as “the poster children for this entire financial event,” by which he meant Americans who seemed to have done everything right on paper, but in doing so contributed to their own downfall. By the time he wrote to Crowley, my father was working again, but it had taken him two years to find another job for much less money. After his run of financial calamity, he knew better than to believe anything good would last. “We are in our 60s and I figure when we get to our mid-70s, life will become difficult again,” he wrote.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1025718\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1025718\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1025718\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2018/01/middle-class-meltdown/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"400,400\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;(Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage-400x400.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage.jpg\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1025718\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage.jpg\" alt=\"A homeowner watches in horror as a house resting on a stack of gold coins topples over him, signifying how the recession affected mortgages.\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage.jpg 400w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage-175x175.jpg 175w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/2019-01-08-overwhelming-mortgage-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1025718\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Crowley’s office wrote back. It was the first time in about two years that a person had responded to our correspondence with encouragement, or something like it. Kevin Casey, who worked for Crowley in Washington, helped arrange a conference call with government liaisons from Citigroup to discuss a different payment plan. The terms were reasonable enough, but the response was like an automated message brought to life: “We are precluded from a regulatory perspective from being able to do what you are asking,” each of the representatives said. What made these exchanges more ridiculous was the fact that Citibank was in the process of retreating from the student loan market by selling off my debt to Discover Financial, who would give us the same response. We were nothing to these companies but a number in a database.</p>\n<p>I used to wonder what the people who worked for these lenders would do if their own children had to take out loans to pay for college. After 10 years, I have come to think of my debt as being like an alcoholic relative who shows up to ruin happy occasions. But when I first got out of school and the reality of how much money I owed finally struck me, the debt was more of a constant and explicit preoccupation, a matter of life and death.</p>\n<p>I had studied English because I wanted to be a writer. I never had an expectation of becoming rich. My M.A. fed an intellectual curiosity that eventually led me to newspapers. I understand now the extent to which I was among the most overeducated group of young adults in human history. Once I could no longer delay and the payments began, I would look at the number on my paycheck and obsessively subtract my rent, the cost of a carton of eggs and a can of beans (my sustenance during the first lean year of this mess), and the price of a loan payment. The question was: What will you do when the money from the paycheck is gone?</p>\n<p>I never arrived at an answer to this question. At my lowest points, I began fantasizing about dying, not because I was suicidal, but because death would have meant relief from having to come up with an answer. The debt was mind-controlling — how I would eat or pay my rent without defaulting was a constant refrain, and I had long since abandoned any hope for a future in which I had a meaningful line of credit or a disposable income or even simply owned something — but also mind-numbingly banal. I spent a great deal of time filling out paperwork over and over again with my personal information and waiting on hold for extended periods in order to speak to a robotic voice rejecting my request.</p>\n<p>And so it felt good to think about dying, in the way that it felt good to take a long nap in order to not be conscious for a while. These thoughts culminated in November 2010, when I met with my father one afternoon to retrieve more paperwork. My hope for some forgiving demise had resulted in my being viciously sick with strep throat. I refused to go to the doctor in the hope that my condition might worsen into a more serious infection that, even if it didn’t kill me, might force someone to at last lavish me with pity. I coughed up a not insignificant portion of ­yellowish fluid, and I started the conversation by asking, “Theoretically, if I were to, say, kill myself, what would happen to the debt?”</p>\n<p>“I would have to pay it myself,” my father said. He paused and then offered me a melancholy smile. “Listen, it’s just debt,” he said. “No one is dying from this.”</p>\n<p>My father had suffered in the previous two years. In a matter of months, he had lost everything he had worked most of his adult life to achieve — first his career, then his home, then his dignity. He had become a 60-year-old man who had quite reluctantly shaved his graying 40-year-old mustache in order to look younger, shuffling between failed job interviews where he was often told he had “too much experience.” He was ultimately forced out of the life he’d known, dragging with him, like some 21st-century Pa Joad, a U-Haul trailer crammed with family possessions, including, at the insistence of my mother, large plastic tubs of my childhood action figures.</p>\n<p>Throughout this misery, my father had reacted with what I suddenly realized was stoicism, but which I had long mistaken for indifference. This misunderstanding was due in part to my mother, who had perhaps suffered most of all. Not that it was a competition, but if it were, I think she would have taken some small amount of satisfaction in winning it. The loss of home and finances felt at least like a worthy opponent for cancer, and yet here was my father telling me that none of this was the end of the world. I was ashamed of my selfishness. The lump in my throat began to feel less infectious than lachrymal. “Okay,” I said to him.

Was it possible we had become lucky?</p>\n<p>It was in the summer of 2017, after my father, now nearing 70, had lost another job, that I finally removed him as a cosigner and refinanced my loans with one of the few companies that provides such a service, SoFi. My wife would help with the payments when she could. Sharing the burden of my debt with my spouse instead of my parents was a small, depressing victory, a milestone perhaps unique to members of my generation.</p>\n<p>SoFi has not made my situation much more tenable, necessarily. The main differences are that I now write one check instead of several, and that I have an end date for when the debt, including the calculated interest — about $182,000 — will be paid off: 2032, when I’ll be 44. What I have to pay each month is still, for the most part, more than I am able to afford. I rely on the help of people I love and live by each paycheck. I still harbor anxiety about the bad things that could befall me should the paycheck disappear.</p>\n<p>But the so-called Important Information I receive has changed. SoFi, which bills itself as a “modern finance company” (its name is shorthand for Social Finance, Inc.), is a Silicon Valley startup that offers, in addition to loans, membership outreach in the form of financial literacy workshops and free dinners. Their aim is to “empower our members,” a mission that was called into question by the resignation, in September 2017, of its CEO, who employees allege had engaged in serial workplace sexual harassment and who ran the office, according to a <em>New York Times</em> headline, like “a frat house.” The news came out not long after I refinanced my loans with the company — I became, I suppose, a SoFi’er, in the company’s parlance. Around this same time, I started receiving curious emails from them: “Dear NYC SoFi’er,” one of these emails read. “Grab a single friend and join us for a fun night at Rare View Rooftop Bar and Lounge in Murray Hill! You’ll mingle with some of our most interesting (and available!) members …” The invitation cited a statistic that promised “86 percent of members at other SoFi Singles events said they met someone they want to see again.”</p>\n<p>I am a 30-year-old married man with more than $100,000 of debt, who makes less each year than what he owes. Buying a pair of pants is a major financial decision for me. I do not think myself “eligible” in any sense of the word. Still, I felt as if in 10 years, the debt hadn’t changed, but the world had, or at least the world’s view of it. This thing, this 21st-century blight, was now so normal — so basic — that it had been co-opted by the wellness industry of Silicon Valley. My debt was now approachable, a way to meet people. It was, in other words, an investment in my future, which is why I had gone into debt in the first place. Would SoFi be this friendly if I lost my job and missed a monthly payment?</p>\n<p>Let’s say I was morbidly intrigued. The day after Valentine’s Day, I went to a Mexican restaurant for a SoFi community dinner — this was not a single’s event, but simply a free meal. SoFi had rented out the back room, where a few dozen people had gathered, all wearing name tags and discussing financial woes. Sid, a software developer who had racked up credit card debt after college, told me that the debt was a unifying force at these gatherings. “When there’s a break in the conversation, someone can just say, ‘So, debt, huh?’ and things will get going again,” he said. “If we walked outside of this room,” he continued, gesturing to the suits by the bar, “everyone out there would have debt, too. It’s just a little more out in the open for us.”</p>\n<p>Despite the name tags, the dinner turned out to resemble something more like an AA meeting, an earnest session of group therapy. Everyone had their story about the problems caused by their student loans and how they were trying, one day at a time, to improve things, and no story was exceptional, including my own. Ian, an employee for Google who had recently successfully paid off his debt from a Columbia MBA program, said he had a few “bone dry” years, where he lived on instant noodles. I told him I had a long way to go. “At least you’re doing something about it,” he said, sincerely.</p>\n<p>We sat down to dinner. Across from me was Mira, a defense attorney who attended law school at Stanford. Her payments amount to $2,300 a month, more than double my own. When I asked her why she came to this event, she glanced at me as if the answer should have been obvious: She went to law school at Stanford, and her payments are $2,300 a month. After the food was served, a waiter came by with a stack of to-go boxes. The group was reluctant at first, but then Ian said, “The chicken was actually pretty good,” as he scooped it into one of the boxes. Mira shrugged, took a fork, and added, “This is a little tacky, but I’d hate to waste free food,” and the rest of the table followed her lead. Maybe the next generation will do better, but I felt like we were broke and broken. No number of degrees or professional successes would put us back together again. For now, though, we knew where our next meal was coming from.</p>\n<p><em>M.H.

        "expected_html": "<article>\n\n<p>“Us” is at once familiar and foreign — it’s a traditional slasher turned and twisted into something radical and bizarre.</p>\n\n<p>The film follows the Wilson family on their annual summer vacation: This year, they’re beach bound. But Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong’o), harboring grim memories from her last visit to the boardwalk, bristles at returning to the site of a mysterious trauma — flashbacks of her nightmarish excursion into a house of mirrors recur throughout the film. Her excitable husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), convinces her to let the past go, and, begrudgingly, she agrees, taking their children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) to the beach.</p>\n\n<p>Their vacation is cut short when a strange family appears in their driveway. They’re wearing red jumpsuits. They’re armed with long, golden scissors. And they look, sound and think exactly like the Wilsons.</p>\n\n<p>Across America, the Tethered have risen.</p>\n\n<p>Even before the scares start, Jordan Peele, writer, director and producer, infuses a persistent uneasiness into the film’s most mundane locals. Cheery amusement parks become nightmarish cacophonies of excess — a couple daintily feeding each other carnival food takes on a sinister aura: like a Rockwell painting gone wrong. And after night falls, and the shear-wielding Tethered emerge from their subterranean home, the film doesn’t descend into generic slasher schlock.</p>\n\n<p>The Tethered are profane parodies, disturbed doppelgangers that emote like something alien desperately trying to pass as human. Though monstrous, they’re not monsters; they’re a lost people traumatized by their dark origins. Each exhibit exaggerated versions of their human traits — while the Wilsons’ friend Josh is playfully obnoxious, his Tethered is sinisterly vaudevillian. Their villainy simultaneously evokes sympathy and revulsion: The balance tipping one way or the other as Peele doles out information about their origin.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, sometimes Peele doesn’t dole so much as dump. Adelaide’s Tethered, Red, also played by Nyong’o, is the only one of her kind capable of speech, and as such, becomes the primary vector for exposition. Twice she halts the action to spell out critical plot and thematic elements, undercutting the preceding tension. Nyong’o’s perpetual rasp and shuffling, jagged movements salvage these otherwise limp moments: Her presence livens up the scenes the plot leaves lifeless.</p>\n\n<p>The sloppy exposition only reveals so much. Much of Peele’s world is left ambiguous; we’re given enough information to understand the basics but come away unable to pin down smaller details. The illogic and peculiarity enhance rather than detract from “Us.” We’re as lost as the Wilsons: desperate to know just a little bit more about the Tethered’s origin.</p>\n\n<p>Like Peele’s “Get Out,” “Us” doesn’t attempt subtlety; Peele’s commentary isn’t subtext, it’s text. Characters explicitly discuss the central metaphor: The inherent suffering caused by systems built on privilege from birth. Peele also capitalizes on the American fear of secret invasions and hidden plots and sums up both themes with a single line: “We’re Americans,” Red said as an introduction.</p>\n\n<p>A final twist blurs the line between good and bad, right and wrong, friend and foe. And though it’s a little like the final line of a “Goosebumps” book, Peele does a remarkable job of seeding the twist from the opening flashback. If you’re thinking there’s something off about Adelaide and her enthusiastic, animalistic displays of violence, you’re on the right track.</p>\n\n<p>For all its twists and turns, “Us” depends on slasher archetypes. The Wilsons are the quintessential horror family — the punny father, the serious mother, the bratty daughter and the eerily precocious son. They’re all there. The only major difference is their race — rarely are black families central figures in a commercial slasher. But Peele’s ability to layer humor over their interactions makes them feel like a family: a real one who knows each other well enough to anticipate Gabe’s bad jokes or Zora’s exasperated teenisms.</p>\n\n<p>It is also not grimly nihilistic in the way slashers tend to be; despite the Tethered’s high body count, the Wilsons come away largely unscathed. It’s refreshing for a horror movie to forgo fetishistic violence and familial destruction — there’s gore aplenty, but it’s not excessive.</p>\n\n<p>“Us” feels like a feature-length “Twilight Zone” episode — which is appropriate given the film was inspired in part by an episode of the show. Peele probes the American psyche, manifests cultural fears and builds on decades of genre classics.</p>\n\n</article>",

And they look, sound and think exactly like the Wilsons. </span></p>\n<p><span>Across America, the Tethered have risen. </span></p>\n<p><span>Even before the scares start, </span><span>Jordan Peele, </span><span>writer, director and producer</span><span>, </span><span>infuses a persistent uneasiness i</span><span>nt</span><span>o the film’s most mundane locals. Cheery amusement parks become nightmarish cacophonies of excess — a couple daintily feeding each other carnival food takes on a sinister aura: like a Rockwell painting gone wrong. And after night falls, and the shear-wielding Tethered emerge from their subterranean home, the film doesn’t descend into generic slasher schlock.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Tethered are profane parodies, disturbed doppelgangers that emote like something alien desperately trying to pass as human. Though monstrous, they’re not monsters; they’re a lost people traumatized by their dark origins. Each exhibit</span> <span>exaggerated versions of their human traits — while the Wilsons’ friend Josh is playfully obnoxious, his Tethered is sinisterly vaudevillian. Their villa</span><span>i</span><span>ny simultaneously evokes sympathy and revulsion: </span><span>T</span><span>he balance tipping one way or the other as Peele doles out information about their origin. </span></p>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, sometimes Peele doesn’t dole so much as dump. Adelaide’s Tethered, Red</span><span>, </span><span>also played by Nyong’o</span><span>,</span><span> is the only one of her kind capable of speech, and as such, becomes the primary vector for exposition. Twice she halts the action to spell out critical plot and thematic elements, undercutting the preceding tension. Nyong’o’s perpetual rasp and shuffling, jagged movements salvage these otherwise limp moments: </span><span>H</span><span>er presence livens up the scenes the plot leaves lifeless.</span></p>\n<p><span>The sloppy exposition only reveals so much. Much of Peele’s world is left ambiguous; </span><span>w</span><span>e’re given enough information to understand the basics</span> <span>but come away unable to pin down smaller details. The illogic and peculiarity enhance rather than detract from “Us.” We’re as lost as the Wilsons: desperate to know just a little bit more about the Tethered’s origin.</span></p>\n<p><span>Like Peele’s “Get Out,” “Us” doesn’t attempt subtlety; Peele’s commentary isn’t subtext, it’s text. Characters explicitly discuss the central metaphor: </span><span>T</span><span>he inherent suffering caused by systems built on privilege from birth. Peele also capitalizes on the American fear of secret invasions and hidden plots and sums up both themes with a single line: “We’re Americans</span><span>,</span><span>” Red sa</span><span>id</span><span> as an introduction. </span></p>\n<p><span>A final twist blurs the line between good and bad, right and wrong, friend and foe. And though it’s a little like the final line of a “Goosebumps” book, Peele does a remarkable job of seeding the twist from the opening flashback. If you’re thinking there’s something off about Adelaide and her enthusiastic, animalistic displays of violence, you’re on the right track. </span></p>\n<p><span>For all its twists and turns, “Us” depends on slasher archetypes. The Wilsons are the quintessential horror family — the punny father, the serious mother, the bratty daughter and the eerily precocious son. They’re all there. The only major difference is their race — rarely are black families central figures in a commercial slasher. But Peele’s ability to layer humor over their interactions makes them feel like a family: a real one who knows each other well enough to anticipate Gabe’s bad jokes or Zora’s exasperated teenisms. </span></p>\n<p><span>It is also not</span><span> grimly nihilistic in the way slashers tend to be; despite the Tethered’s high body count, the Wilsons come away largely unscathed. It’s refreshing for a horror movie to forgo fetishistic violence and familial destruction — there’s gore aplenty, but it’s not excessive. </span></p>\n<p><span>“Us” feels like a feature-length “Twilight Zone” episode — which is appropriate given the film was inspired in part by an episode of the show. Peele probes the American psyche, manifests cultural fears and builds on decades of genre classics. </span></p>\n\n          </section>",

        "expected_html": "<article>\n\n<h2>Many problems exist with Kim Kardashian’s recent photo shoot</h2>\n\n<p>By now, many people have seen the nude and oiled up photos of Kim Kardashian taken for the cover of Paper magazine with a title of “Break the Internet.”</p>\n\n<p>The photographs made an enormous splash on the Internet since Kardashian is a mother and people are usually prone to take the opportunity to view a naked celebrity. But there are more important things to worry about regarding these photos.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone wants to show off their naked bodies, even if they’ve had children, they should be able to. Mothers are allowed to feel sexy and confident about how they look. They should be able to show their bodies off any way they like — a category that includes Kardashian. The photos of Kardashian, though, have been modified to look better than the average mother’s body possibly can.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the photos, you see her skin has absolutely no blemishes or cellulite. Instead, there’s oil so the lights can bounce off her “flawless skin.” What’s more upsetting is that it appears her waist has been taken in so much it looks as if she had a couple of her ribs taken out. Nothing screams greatness about these photos. She nearly looks inhuman.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside the photoshopping fiesta, there is a problem with the photographer Kardashian chose to work with for this shoot. Jean-Paul Goude, the photographer, has been known to have a facination with black women and likes to pose these black women as objects.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, in 1981 he released a book of photographs titled “Jungle Fever.” In these photos, he had models posed as servants or slaves, which objectified their bodies.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the pictures he has taken involve naked black women wrapped up in chains. There are pictures of a black female model crawling around nude inside of a cage. Goude posed her to look more like an animal than a person. He is known to have a fascination with the behinds of black women and makes it crystal clear in his photography.</p>\n\n<p>So why would Kardashian want to work with a man who purposely portrays black women like objects and animals? It doesn’t take much research to find out about the controversy surrounding Goude’s photography.</p>\n\n<p>In the photo shoot, Goude had Kardashian pose with a champagne bottle in hand, while the drink shot over her head and landed into a glass balanced on her behind. The same improbable pose had her knees bent, as if she were serving someone. Kardashian wore a strapless black dress with matching gloves.</p>\n\n<p>The same photographer has actually already done this picture. Except, in the first instance, Goude’s model was a naked black woman. Nudity could not possibly make the model look as elegant as Kardashian looked on the cover of Paper magazine.</p>\n\n<p>There is plenty of controversy to Kardashian’s recent photos. But having Goude take these photos, despite the themes his past photo work demonstrates, is more than a bad judgment call. These photos have to be the worst thing Kardashian could have done with her modeling career.</p>\n\n</article>",

Mothers are allowed to feel sexy and confident about how they look. They should be able to show their bodies off any way they like — a category that includes Kardashian. The photos of Kardashian, though, have been modified to look better than the average mother’s body possibly can.</p>\n<p>Looking at the photos, you see her skin has absolutely no blemishes or cellulite. Instead, there’s oil so the lights can bounce off her “flawless skin.” What’s more upsetting is that it appears her waist has been taken in so much it looks as if she had a couple of her ribs taken out. Nothing screams greatness about these photos. She nearly looks inhuman.</p>\n<p>Alongside the photoshopping fiesta, there is a problem with the photographer Kardashian chose to work with for this shoot. Jean-Paul Goude, the photographer, has been known to have a facination with black women and likes to pose these black women as objects.</p>\n<p>In fact, in 1981 he released a book of photographs titled “Jungle Fever.” In these photos, he had models posed as servants or slaves, which objectified their bodies.</p>\n<p>Some of the pictures he has taken involve naked black women wrapped up in chains. There are pictures of a black female model crawling around nude inside of a cage. Goude posed her to look more like an animal than a person. He is known to have a fascination with the behinds of black women and makes it crystal clear in his photography.</p>\n<p>So why would Kardashian want to work with a man who purposely portrays black women like objects and animals? It doesn’t take much research to find out about the controversy surrounding Goude’s photography.</p>\n<p>In the photo shoot, Goude had Kardashian pose with a champagne bottle in hand, while the drink shot over her head and landed into a glass balanced on her behind. The same improbable pose had her knees bent, as if she were serving someone. Kardashian wore a strapless black dress with matching gloves.</p>\n<p>The same photographer has actually already done this picture. Except, in the first instance, Goude’s model was a naked black woman. Nudity could not possibly make the model look as elegant as Kardashian looked on the cover of Paper magazine.</p>\n<p>There is plenty of controversy to Kardashian’s recent photos. But having Goude take these photos, despite the themes his past photo work demonstrates, is more than a bad judgment call. These photos have to be the worst thing Kardashian could have done with her modeling career.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<hr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>",

        "expected_html": "<article>\n\n<p><em>Writer Tara Calishain shares tips and tools so you can learn to do cool stuff with technology.</em></p>\n\n<p>Headlines about artificial intelligence are almost uniformly grim: it’s the worst thing ever, the robots are coming, they’re taking our jobs, Daleks will rule the earth. Behind the headlines, though, things are a bit more prosaic: AI has a long road ahead of it. While it’s good at some things, it’s awful at others, and I don’t take seriously any robots that have to levitate to get up stairs (sorry, Daleks).</p>\n\n<p>If you want to get a sample of what AI can do right now, take a look at photo apps on the web. Editing photos is often daunting, but web apps make it easy. If you can upload a photo, you can use a web app to colorize it, remove the background, and more!</p>\n\n<p>These tools can’t take the place of a full-fledged photo editor like GIMP or Photoshop, or even a heavy-duty web app like PicMonkey. On the other hand, they’re free, and there’s no learning curve. If you’re interested in editing photos but don’t know how to get started, these apps can help you dip your toe in the water and get a sense of the possibilities.</p>\n\n<figure><img data-attachment-id=\"1033780\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2019/04/put-artificial-intelligence-to-work-on-your-photo-editing/image_one/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_One.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"318,374\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Image_One\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_One.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_One.jpg\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_One.jpg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Munsie. (Tara Calishain)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>For comparison I’ll be using this photo of my great-great-grandmother, Munsie, and showing you what four different sites can do to enhance this picture.</p>\n\n<h2>Colorize It</h2>\n\n<p>Colorizing photos is equally an art and a skill, and an AI-based app is not going to come close to the ability of a human colorist. At the same time, not everyone has the time or the ability to learn to colorize. These apps won’t be perfect, but you’ll be surprised how good they are. Note also that not all coloring apps are equal. The two I’m going to show you here will give you very different results. Pick the one you like best or try a lot of different photos for comparison.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://demos.algorithmia.com/colorize-photos/\">Algorithmia</a></h3>\n\n<figure><img data-attachment-id=\"1033782\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2019/04/put-artificial-intelligence-to-work-on-your-photo-editing/image_two/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Two.png\" data-orig-size=\"318,374\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Image_Two\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Two.png\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Two.png\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Two.png\" alt=\"Colorize with Algorithmia. (Tara Calishain)\"><figcaption>Colorize with Algorithmia. (Tara Calishain)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>With Algorithmia, you can upload a picture or choose one from the web. The instant you do, Algorithmia will start colorizing it and provide you with a comparison image. You can download that or download the fully-colorized photo. Here’s a comparison of Munsie.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the image is almost sepia-toned except for the red in the jacket. I suspect it’s because this picture was taken outside in full sunlight and the image is accounting for the glare.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://colourise.sg/#colorize\">Colourise.sg</a></h3>\n\n<p>Colourise treats the image quite differently. This app was developed by GovTech Singapore, and the images it used to train its AI to color photos was completely different, which shows up in how it colors the picture of Munsie:</p>\n\n<figure><img data-attachment-id=\"1033783\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2019/04/put-artificial-intelligence-to-work-on-your-photo-editing/image_three/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2208,1298\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Image_Three\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-400x235.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-500x294.jpg\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-500x294.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-500x294.jpg 500w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-400x235.jpg 400w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-768x451.jpg 768w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-600x353.jpg 600w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three.jpg 2208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\"><figcaption>Colourise. (Tara Calishain)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>As you can see, Colourise went more for a green tint than red. I like this better because of the enhanced difference between Munsie’s skin and the wall behind her. Furthermore, her hair looks more natural, and not like there’s been a sheen of color applied to it. All photos are different, though, and I wouldn’t settle on using Colourise exclusively based on the processing of one image.</p>\n\n<h2>Take Out the Background with Remove.bg</h2>\n\n<p>I’m willing to bet that you have a picture of someone where you’d like to remove the background. Whether it’s because you want to get rid of somebody behind you or because the setting isn’t flattering, removing background images can be so useful but at the same time so difficult. But not with <a href=\"https://www.remove.bg/\">Remove.bg</a>. Try this tool with a photo and you will feel like a wizard. In just a few seconds you’ll get a clean image with no or very little background.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of caveats to be aware of: Remove.bg works best for single individuals, and it only works on humans (can’t take the background out of your dog picture!). All you have to do is upload your photo. Here’s the picture of Munsie with the background removed:</p>\n\n<figure><img data-attachment-id=\"1033784\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2019/04/put-artificial-intelligence-to-work-on-your-photo-editing/image_four/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Four.png\" data-orig-size=\"318,374\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Image_Four\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Four.png\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Four.png\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Four.png\" alt=\"Remove.bg. (Tara Calishain)\"><figcaption>Remove.bg. (Tara Calishain)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>It’s almost perfect in only seconds. The only thing Remove.bg missed is the arm beside Munsie (probably because the arm and her jacket are so close together) and a bit of shadow.</p>\n\n<p>Remove.bg does offer the option of editing the image further before downloading it, but I found the tools a little awkward.

        "raw_html": "<div class=\"post-body [-locked]\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n<p><em>Writer Tara Calishain shares tips and tools so you can learn to do cool stuff with technology.</em></p>\n<p>Headlines about artificial intelligence are almost uniformly grim: it’s the worst thing ever, the robots are coming, they’re taking our jobs, Daleks will rule the earth. Behind the headlines, though, things are a bit more prosaic: AI has a long road ahead of it. While it’s good at some things, it’s awful at others, and I don’t take seriously any robots that have to levitate to get up stairs (sorry, Daleks).</p>\n<p>If you want to get a sample of what AI can do right now, take a look at photo apps on the web. Editing photos is often daunting, but web apps make it easy. If you can upload a photo, you can use a web app to colorize it, remove the background, and more!</p>\n\n<p>These tools can’t take the place of a full-fledged photo editor like GIMP or Photoshop, or even a heavy-duty web app like PicMonkey. On the other hand, they’re free, and there’s no learning curve. If you’re interested in editing photos but don’t know how to get started, these apps can help you dip your toe in the water and get a sense of the possibilities.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1033780\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1033780\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1033780\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2019/04/put-artificial-intelligence-to-work-on-your-photo-editing/image_one/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_One.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"318,374\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Image_One\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_One.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_One.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-1033780 size-full\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_One.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"318\" height=\"374\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1033780\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Munsie.

At the same time, not everyone has the time or the ability to learn to colorize. These apps won’t be perfect, but you’ll be surprised how good they are. Note also that not all coloring apps are equal. The two I’m going to show you here will give you very different results. Pick the one you like best or try a lot of different photos for comparison.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://demos.algorithmia.com/colorize-photos/\">Algorithmia</a></h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1033782\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1033782\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1033782\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2019/04/put-artificial-intelligence-to-work-on-your-photo-editing/image_two/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Two.png\" data-orig-size=\"318,374\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Image_Two\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Two.png\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Two.png\" class=\"wp-image-1033782 size-full\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Two.png\" alt=\"Colorize with Algorithmia.

The instant you do, Algorithmia will start colorizing it and provide you with a comparison image. You can download that or download the fully-colorized photo. Here’s a comparison of Munsie.</p>\n<p class=\"clearfix\">As you can see, the image is almost sepia-toned except for the red in the jacket. I suspect it’s because this picture was taken outside in full sunlight and the image is accounting for the glare.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://colourise.sg/#colorize\">Colourise.sg</a></h3>\n<p>Colourise treats the image quite differently. This app was developed by GovTech Singapore, and the images it used to train its AI to color photos was completely different, which shows up in how it colors the picture of Munsie:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1033783\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1033783\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1033783\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2019/04/put-artificial-intelligence-to-work-on-your-photo-editing/image_three/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2208,1298\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Image_Three\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-400x235.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-500x294.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-1033783\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-500x294.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"860\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-500x294.jpg 500w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-400x235.jpg 400w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-768x451.jpg 768w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three-600x353.jpg 600w, https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Three.jpg 2208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1033783\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Colourise. (Tara Calishain)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As you can see, Colourise went more for a green tint than red. I like this better because of the enhanced difference between Munsie’s skin and the wall behind her. Furthermore, her hair looks more natural, and not like there’s been a sheen of color applied to it. All photos are different, though, and I wouldn’t settle on using Colourise exclusively based on the processing of one image.</p>\n<h2>Take Out the Background with Remove.bg</h2>\n<p>I’m willing to bet that you have a picture of someone where you’d like to remove the background. Whether it’s because you want to get rid of somebody behind you or because the setting isn’t flattering, removing background images can be so useful but at the same time so difficult. But not with <a href=\"https://www.remove.bg/\">Remove.bg</a>. Try this tool with a photo and you will feel like a wizard. In just a few seconds you’ll get a clean image with no or very little background.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of caveats to be aware of: Remove.bg works best for single individuals, and it only works on humans (can’t take the background out of your dog picture!). All you have to do is upload your photo. Here’s the picture of Munsie with the background removed:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1033784\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1033784\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1033784\" data-permalink=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2019/04/put-artificial-intelligence-to-work-on-your-photo-editing/image_four/\" data-orig-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Four.png\" data-orig-size=\"318,374\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Image_Four\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Four.png\" data-large-file=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Four.png\" class=\"wp-image-1033784 size-full\" src=\"https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/Image_Four.png\" alt=\"Remove.bg.

(Tara Calishain)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s almost perfect in only seconds. The only thing Remove.bg missed is the arm beside Munsie (probably because the arm and her jacket are so close together) and a bit of shadow.</p>\n<p>Remove.bg does offer the option of editing the image further before downloading it, but I found the tools a little awkward. If you’d be comfortable using that, you’d probably be more comfortable using GIMP or Photoshop, which would give you more options for cleaning up the image.

Though it’s one of the cardinal rules of being a mascot to keep your real identity a secret, Lozano, 52, has been in a Cornhusker mascot costume since 1992.</p>\n\n<p>“I thought, wow it would be so cool to be that character and make kids smile,” Lozano said, recalling one of the first times he saw Herbie Husker. He knew he wanted to make his way into the giant Herbie Husker suit, but he wasn’t sure how. Until he picked up a copy of the Daily Nebraskan his sophomore year.</p>\n\n<p>“I saw an ad in [The Daily Nebraskan] calling for mascots, there were tryouts,” Lozano said. “Without any experience and I had a lot of extra sugar on my cereal that morning, I went for it. Twenty-six years later, here I am.”</p>\n\n<p>After Lozano graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1994, he knew he wanted to work for NU and with students in some capacity. While working in the office of scholarships and financial aid, Lozano became a volunteer assistant for the spirit squad. At one point, he was the sole sponsor for cheerleading, dance team and mascots. Today, he works alongside head coach Erynn Nicholson as the manager of operations.</p>\n\n<p>“I basically created this position,” Lozano said. “I do behind the scenes, making sure the mascot costumes are clean and ready to go, coaching the mascots, make sure the cheerleaders and dancers have their food, working with equipment, and really knowing the game.”</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://www.newsnetnebraska.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.newsnetnebraska.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://cojmc.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://cojmc.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3-300x200.jpg 300w, http://cojmc.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3-768x512.jpg 768w, http://cojmc.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3.jpg 1296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>Lozano takes care of the whole Husker Spirit Squad, making sure the mascots, cheerleaders and dancers are ready for every event.</p>\n\n<p>Lozano explains the role of a mascot as something that is for entertainment, but also for information. The importance of knowing the rules and flow of different sports is huge for a mascot, because the crowd looks to them for reactions.</p>\n\n<p>“Whether you are crying, laughing, mad, excited, you exaggerate those characters big,” Lozano said.

Though it’s one of the cardinal rules of being a mascot to keep your real identity a secret, Lozano, 52, has been in a Cornhusker mascot costume since 1992.</p>\n<p>“I thought, wow it would be so cool to be that character and make kids smile,” Lozano said, recalling one of the first times he saw Herbie Husker. He knew he wanted to make his way into the giant Herbie Husker suit, but he wasn’t sure how. Until he picked up a copy of the Daily Nebraskan his sophomore year.</p>\n<p>“I saw an ad in [The Daily Nebraskan] calling for mascots, there were tryouts,” Lozano said. “Without any experience and I had a lot of extra sugar on my cereal that morning, I went for it. Twenty-six years later, here I am.”</p>\n<p>After Lozano graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1994, he knew he wanted to work for NU and with students in some capacity. While working in the office of scholarships and financial aid, Lozano became a volunteer assistant for the spirit squad. At one point, he was the sole sponsor for cheerleading, dance team and mascots. Today, he works alongside head coach Erynn Nicholson as the manager of operations.</p>\n<p>“I basically created this position,” Lozano said. “I do behind the scenes, making sure the mascot costumes are clean and ready to go, coaching the mascots, make sure the cheerleaders and dancers have their food, working with equipment, and really knowing the game.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_64783\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.newsnetnebraska.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-64783\" src=\"http://www.newsnetnebraska.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"http://cojmc.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://cojmc.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3-300x200.jpg 300w, http://cojmc.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3-768x512.jpg 768w, http://cojmc.webfactional.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Marlon-3.jpg 1296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lozano takes care of the whole Husker Spirit Squad, making sure the mascots, cheerleaders and dancers are ready for every event.</p></div>\n<p>Lozano explains the role of a mascot as something that is for entertainment, but also for information. The importance of knowing the rules and flow of different sports is huge for a mascot, because the crowd looks to them for reactions.</p>\n<p>“Whether you are crying, laughing, mad, excited, you exaggerate those characters big,” Lozano said.

The lights in their new collection are a result of these investigations, he says.</p>\n\n<p>Pete says the Array light, for example, was designed as a reflector light to create an indirect light source.</p>\n\n<p>“Indirect light is actually the most uniform and pleasant light to be working under or around because it’s so soft and doesn’t produce any strong shadows or any shadows at all,” he says.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve this effect, Peet used an 18-inch diameter disc that acts as the reflector for a smaller four-inch diameter disc housed underneath, which holds the light source. The discs are connected together by a rail that acts as a separator, and come as a single pendant or with up to five discs if the desired look is more linear.</p>\n\n<p>“It works well over a table or work surface or anywhere there is an even, task light needed,” he says.</p>\n\n<p>Another new light to be presented at Euroluce is the Vale pendant, designed by Peet’s design partner Caine Heintzman. The Vale is another experiment into light manipulation, says Peet, with a textured acrylic sheet moulded around the light source to diffuse it and direct it, almost like a lens.</p>\n\n<p>When a few of these Vale pendants are presented together they resemble peaks and valleys, which is where the pendant got its name, Peet says.</p>\n\n<p>Also included in the new collection is the Pivot desk lamp, which allows the user to manipulate light using a metal lamp shade, which moves much like an elbow or shoulder joint and allows light to be directed in different directions.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://postmediavancouversun2.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/pivot.jpg?w=640&amp;quality=60&amp;strip=all\"><figcaption>\n<p>\n\nPivot desk lamp designed by Lukas Peet of ANDlight.

The Vale is another experiment into light manipulation, says Peet, with a textured acrylic sheet moulded around the light source to diffuse it and direct it, almost like a lens.</p><p>When a few of these Vale pendants are presented together they resemble peaks and valleys, which is where the pendant got its name, Peet says.</p><p><span>Also included in the new collection is the Pivot desk lamp, which allows the user to manipulate light using a metal lamp shade, which moves much like an elbow or shoulder joint and allows light to be directed in different directions.</span></p><figure id=\"attachment_\" class=\"wp-caption post-img size_this_image_test align-center\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemid=\"photo url\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><img src=\"https://postmediavancouversun2.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/pivot.jpg?w=640&amp;quality=60&amp;strip=all\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text wp-caption\">\n<p>\n<span class=\"img-caption\">\nPivot desk lamp designed by Lukas Peet of ANDlight.

These ahistorical readings erase activists like Tarana Burke, the founder of the movement, as well as early accusers who did not have a hashtag, let alone any support or sympathy from their industry.</p>\n\n<p>The new documentary <em>Rocking the Couch</em>, written and directed by Minh Collins and produced by Andrea Evans, focuses on sexual-misconduct allegations from the early ‘90s, but makes sure to establish that predatory behavior and sexual assault have always been Hollywood staples. This alternative history of Hollywood begins with the absolutely horrifying story of Virginia Rappe. In 1921, the American actress was allegedly raped by silent film star Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle. Rappe died four days after the alleged attack, and Arbuckle was charged with manslaughter. After the first two cases ended in a hung jury, Arbuckle was eventually acquitted in his third trial. But, as the documentary points out, his career never recovered—a far cry from <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/screenwriter-max-landis-stages-his-metoo-comeback-with-a-girl-power-action-movie\">our current wave of #MeToo comebacks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After a heavily-abridged history of sexual-assault allegations in old-timey Hollywood, <em>Rocking the Couch</em> fast-forwards to the ‘80s and ‘90s. The documentary’s strongest and most compelling interviews are with a number of current and former actresses, reflecting on the sexual harassment and assault that functioned as their introductions to the entertainment industry.</p>\n\n<p>Tonja Walker, a former Miss USA contestant, recalls moving out to L.A. and immediately getting soap opera work. At one casting, she met a soap star who proceeded to ask her out for dinner. Walker was excited for the date; she remembers hours of careful preparation, getting ready for their plans at 6:30. He showed up hours late, in a hockey jersey. “I knew immediately that this was bad,” she explains. They walked to pick up pizza, with Walker noting that, “I couldn’t wait to go home and be done with him.” At her door, she said goodnight—“and he said, not so fast.” The anonymous star closed her door and pushed her toward the bedroom, saying, “You know you want to do this.” He raped her and left, and she never heard from him again.</p>\n\n<p>“Just because somebody’s famous, doesn’t mean they’re a good person,” Walker warns.</p>\n\n<p>The documentary is distractingly littered with clips of a criminal defense attorney explaining basic terms, like sexual harassment and battery. In addition to being unnecessarily 101, these interludes take away from the accumulation of testimony after testimony, women whose stories mirror one another’s, simultaneously revealing the horror of sexual assault and its mundanity.</p>\n\n<p>Alana Crow, an actress, shares stories of two separate attacks over the course of the film. While working on a soap one day, she was called into the stage manager’s office to sign her contract. The office was in the basement; she remembers walking in and hearing the door slam behind her. Crow was called back to set while she was being sexually assaulted. “I just sort of reorganized myself,” she narrates, “I had to get back upstairs. I just proceeded with the day, got through that day.” Crow called the union, presumably the Screen Actors Guild, but they “just said to do nothing, because I would be blacklisted from the network.”</p>\n\n<p>“So I just bit the bullet and went on with my life, but it was always bothering me.” The documentary goes on to relay that, many years later, the stage manager for <em>General Hospital</em>, Jerry Blumenthal, was fired for sexual harassment. During an <a href=\"https://variety.com/1993/tv/news/dga-ends-challenge-to-abc-firing-103767/\">arbitration hearing</a> contesting the firing, 12 women testified that they were sexually harassed on set.</p>\n\n<p>After leaving Hollywood, Crow eventually returned in 1991, this time focusing on voice-acting work. In need of an agent, she started working her way down a list provided to her by the union. After a number of no’s, she approached the office of Wallace Kaye. Despite Crow’s specific career objectives, Kaye insisted that she read some commercial and then some theatrical copy. Eventually, he gave her a “sexy secretary script” and offered to read with her. “He moved in closer as we were reading,” she recalls. “I remember he grabbed my hand and put it right in his lap and he goes, how do you like the feel of my cock, something like that. And I tried pulling my hand away… he was much larger than I was.” Kaye continued to grab at her; meanwhile, “I was remembering what had happened before on the soap, and I was starting to panic.”</p>\n\n<figure><iframe type=\"text/html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIjDIKI_TY8?&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autoplay=0\"></iframe></figure>\n\n<p>“I can’t go through this again,” she remembers thinking. “I just don’t want to be raped again.”</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, another actress knocked on the door, and Crow was able to get free. She remembers waiting until the other actress was done talking to Kaye, because she didn’t want to leave her alone with him.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, Crow called her union, and once again, she was told that there was little she could do. They suggested she write a letter of complaint, which she did. According to the doc, SAG failed to respond, despite a “half-dozen other sexual-assault complaints about Mr. Wallace.” SAG-AFTRA did not respond to <em>Rocking the Couch</em>’s requests for comment on the case.</p>\n\n<p>The allegations against Wallace Kaye finally came to light when a non-guild actress was turned away from filing a complaint with SAG, and instead reported to the Burbank Police Department. This leads to a surreal-seeming anecdote, in which the gang special investigations unit was called upon to catch Kaye in the act. A female detective, posing as an aspiring actress, set up a meeting with the talent agent. She was wearing a wire, and had police backup outside. This officer, Susan Hayn, tells the story in horrifying, exact detail—how Kaye locked the door and gave her the secretary skit, eventually starting to grab at her and kiss her. Detective Hayn pushed Kaye away and left the room. “When I was in that office I didn’t have my gun, I didn’t have anybody in there,” she recalls. “And when he was doing this to me it literally was disgusting… it was sickening.” She remembers leaving the office and going to her mother’s house to take a shower, “Just cause I wanted to cleanse myself.”</p>\n\n<p>Kaye <a href=\"https://variety.com/1993/biz/news/agent-gets-5-years-for-assaults-107690/\">was arrested on multiple counts of sexual battery</a>. In interviews with the D.A. and Kaye’s lawyer, we learn that Kaye and his wife adamantly refused to entertain any plea deals, insisting on his innocence. Kaye testified that all of the women were lying. “Some of them, in his opinion, were looking for some fame or notoriety.” The judge ultimately sentenced Kaye to five years and four months in jail. Afterwards, Detective Susan Hayn formally introduced herself to Kaye in his cell, where an apparently unrepentant Kaye insisted, “I knew she was a cop,” and called Hayn a “lousy actress.”</p>\n\n<p>The documentary’s main thesis appears to be that the cases of Jerry Blumenthal and Wallace Kaye, among others, could have spurred a MeToo-style movement in the early ’90s, were it not for SAG-AFTRA and wider industry complicity. A 1992 <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-11-16-9204130900-story.html\"><em>Chicago Tribune</em></a> article, “Casting couch on the way out,” also mentioned these two offenders, noting that, “women in the entertainment industry are speaking out in seminars and newsletters, filing complaints and lawsuits and taking steps to make their labor unions take sexual harassment more seriously.”</p>\n\n<p>But these women were clearly fighting an uphill battle. As the <em>Tribune</em> article <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-11-16-9204130900-story.html\">continues</a>, “Marvin Kaplan, president of the Los Angeles local of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, suggested in an editorial this month in the union magazine that sexual harassment is a two-sided issue, stressing the idea that actresses come on to executives. ‘It was rape, rape, rape all summer long,’ Kaplan wrote with sarcasm. ‘Sexual harassment, no matter how repugnant, is not on most people`s lists of union priorities.’”</p>\n\n<p><em>Rocking the Couch</em> ends on a second set of stories—those that might have been prevented had the industry taken the issue of widespread sexual harassment and assault more seriously. These accounts are interspersed with victim-shaming talking head interviews that seemingly attempt to complicate the issue; a male producer talking about how women will offer to sleep with him to appear in a film (“it’s a double-edged sword”), and another one claiming that some accusers come forward to get talk show offers. These ill-conceived attempts to offer another side of the story just detract from the testimonies at hand. An actress who has chosen to remain anonymous tells a story of meeting an agent for dinner: “He ended up putting something in my drink… I remember waking up at his house and the next morning didn’t know what happened.”</p>\n\n<p>Two actresses, Lauren Anastasi-Peter and Sadie Katz, offer juxtaposed accounts of their early years in the industry. Katz recalls a string of dinners with male producers, set up by her female manager. “I’m sort of unknowingly part of this escort business!” she exclaims. “I’m not sleeping with these guys, but I’m so young… This is the kind of stuff that happens to young actors, and I just didn’t know it.” She finally realized what was going on when one of the producers suggested that she write “willing to give BJs” on her résumé if she really wanted to get parts.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in New York, Anastasi-Peter went to a casting in an apartment building. When it was her turn, she left the lobby full of aspiring actresses and went up to a room; the director promptly left, trusting the star of the film, “Josh,” with his fictional girlfriend’s casting. “Josh” urged her to be “uninhibited” in the scene, and took his clothes off. She took her shirt off as well. “I’m not finding any of this uncomfortable,” she recalls, “It was professional.” At one point in the scene, she remembers seeing a video camera, possibly recording. As soon as the lines are over, they both got dressed, and he told her that she nailed the scene. Anastasi-Peter remembers leaving the building and being hit with a wave of nausea and understanding—“I felt like I was going to vomit.” She walked back in and asked the women in the lobby if the audition was recorded, but they were flustered and didn’t give her a clear answer. Anastasi-Peter searched the internet for years, terrified that the tape would get out. She didn’t audition for any more films after that.</p>\n\n</article>",

She was born in Boston to James F. Roberts and Bertha E. Platt-Roberts on December 25, 1932 and raised in Roxbury by her parents, and influenced by her grandmother Minnie Canty-Platt and several aunts. She was one of 15 children, and given the nickname “Honey” as an infant by her father.</p>\n\n<p>She attended Boston Public Schools, graduating from Girls High School. Soon after, she married her high school sweetheart Joseph N. Small, Sr. in 1951, and began their family of six children, raising them together in Duxbury. She was a loving and devoted mother, who attended many of her children’s activities, including serving as a Boy Scout “den mother” for two of her sons. She could always be found in the stands rooting for her children at school sports and other events. It wasn’t uncommon to find her advocating for other children of color in the local school system.</p>\n\n<p>She began her work career as an administrative assistant with Hood Rubber Company. During the early years of raising her family she went on to get her cosmetology license, and established a home-based salon serving customers out of a special wing her husband built in their home. She also supported her husband’s launch of Smalltren Engineering, a high precision tool and die company, starting out in the basement of their home before its eventual location to Rockland. Together they were recognized by the U.S. Commerce Department and President Richard Nixon in 1973 for their work as small business entrepreneurs. Never one to be idle, she later went on to attend Bridgewater State University where she earned her associate degree. Martha later worked for 12 years as office manager for Gillespie Ford in Marshfield, followed by 10 years as the Business Manager for AFSCME 93, the union for county and municipal employees before eventually retiring.</p>\n\n<p>Honey enjoyed traveling. She and Joe Sr. took their children on many vacations including Barbados, and summers on Martha’s Vineyard. Later she continued her journeys with trips to Greece and the Islands. Her door was always open. Many family members and friends enjoyed barbecues and extended stays at her home in Duxbury. She relocated to Randolph in 2000 where she became a beloved resident of the Jasper Lane Condominium complex.</p>\n\n<p>Honey was committed to helping others, thus she participated in and was recognized by many professional and civic organizations including the Women’s Service Club of Boston. She was a past president of the 464 Community Workshop and participated in their annual “follies,” a variety show which raised money for under privileged children to attend summer camp. She also served in the Sarah Gorham Women’s Missionary Society of Charles Street AME Church, and was a charter member of the South Shore chapter of the NAACP. She served as a past president of the Boston and Vicinity Club and was a life member of the National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women’s Clubs Inc. and was honored to receive their “National Sojourner Truth Award” in 2003 for her meritorious community service. Honey also served on the board of the Roxbury Multi-Service Center, and was a member of the “Over-the-Hill Gang.”</p>\n\n<p>Martha was an avid reader and enjoyed doing crossword puzzles and crafting, especially knitting sweaters, blankets and hats for her children and grandchildren. She was a devotee to her church, the historic Charles Street A.M.E. Church in Roxbury, where she was recognized as a “mother of the church.”</p>\n\n<p>She leaves behind six children: Joseph Small Sr., Craig Sr., Lance Sr., Kurtis Sr., daughters Sharna (Joseph) Borsellino, and Tracey (Cliff) Wilson, 12 grandchildren Lance Jr. (Ashley), Craig Jr. (Ana), Tiffany (Jared) Boyd, Marcus (Jasmin), India (William), Kurtis Jr. “Troy”, Isaiah, Halle Hall, Joseph, Daryl, Sicily and Quincy, and 11 greatgrandchildren: Stephanie, Rafael, Adrian, Donte’, Olivia, Callen, Braelyn, Simone, Riley, Raiden and Landen.</p>\n\n<p>She was preceded in death by her parents James and Bertha (Platt) Roberts, brothers Joseph, Clarence, Timothy, Mark, and sister Shirley, and her former husband Joseph N. Small, Sr. She is survived by siblings Charles Sr., James Jr., Betty, David, Rosetha “Tiny,” Lawrence, Donna, Helen and Marlene. She also leaves behind an extended family including a host of cousins, nieces, nephews, and close friends.</p>\n\n<p>A Celebration of Life service is scheduled for Friday, May 10, 2019 at 11 a.m. at Charles Street AME Church, 551 Warren St., Boston, MA followed by a repast at 1 p.m. at the Hilton Boston/Dedham, 25 Allied Drive, Dedham.</p>\n\n<p>Memorial Donations may be made in Martha’s name to the Alzheimer’s Association, <a href=\"http://www.alz.org\">www.alz.org</a> or to Charles Street AME Church, <a href=\"http://www.csamechurch.org/giving.\">www.csamechurch.org/giving.</a></p>\n\n<p>To post a sympathy message visit <a href=\"http://www.DavisofBoston.com\">www.DavisofBoston.com</a></p>\n\n</article>",

So for him to go out with a win and on a high note was pretty special.”</p>\n\n<p>De Graaf’s family even housed Murchison during the City Junior, which was contested at the Edmonton Petroleum Club.</p>\n\n<p>Murchison, who finished fifth in the Canadian Junior two years ago, opened the two-day tournament with a bogey-free, 5-under 66 — believed to be a record low score for the tournament — and then followed up with a 73 to edge de Graaf, who went 70-73, by four shots.</p>\n\n<p>Those four shots could be pinpointed to one hole: No. 17.</p>\n\n<p>“That hole has my number,” de Graaf said of the tough, tight and long dog-leg right Par 4 that he double-bogeyed both days.</p>\n\n<p>“First round, I was long and put it in the left trees; the second round my anti-left swing went into the right trees.”</p>\n\n<p>This was Murchison’s second Edmonton Junior victory, his first coming three years ago when he birdied four of his last five holes at Glendale.</p>\n\n<p>Murchison had the vibes going coming into the tournament. In his practice round, he aced No. 15 from 150 yards with an 8-iron.</p>\n\n<p>“That gave me a good feeling. My only other hole-in-one was in high school provincials, and I went on to win that tournament, too,” said Murchison.</p>\n\n<p>Kaitlyn Wingnean, 15, won the overall girl’s title by nine shots — and her 16-and-under division by, gasp, 27 strokes — with rounds of 77-80.</p>\n\n<p>In other divisions, St. Albert’s Brooke Brezovski, playing up a flight, defeated Sherwood Park’s Alyshia Suleman in a playoff in the girl’s 18-and-under event — both players shooting 166 for the two days — while Brooke’s younger sister, Belle, won the 14-and-under Junior Girls by one shot over the Derrick’s Alexa Wingnean, Kaitlyn’s younger sister.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Braden O’Grady won the 16-and-under Junior; Mitchell Shaigec took the 14-and-under Junior; Scott Levey won the 12-and-under boys, and Kalee Seto took the 12-and-under girls.</p>\n\n<h2>Scene</h2>\n\n<p>Sturgeon Valley’s Belle Brezovski also won the McLennan Ross Stony Plain stop with an 80.</p>\n\n<p>And Belvedere’s Jarrett Bossert won his third McLennan Ross event in his last four starts when he took on Black Bull and shot a 75, two better than River Ridge’s Josh Robertson.</p>\n\n<h2>Noted</h2>\n\n<ul><li>In addition to Murchison, there were a trillion holes-in-one last week, including three on the same day at the Edmonton Country Club: Karen Holmes on No. 4 from 135 yards and Sheila Marks on No. 13 from 115 yards — both in Ladies Day play — and then Brad Simons continuing the roll with a hole-in-one on No. 18 from 170 yards with a 5-iron.</li> <li>Not done with the Country Club, Mario Mancini also got in on the act with a hole-in-one on the tough 13th hole: 217 yards with a 5-wood.</li> <li>There were also a trio of recent aces at Raven Crest, all on Ladies Day and all on No. 3 from 114 yards: Karen Kreway, Susan Kitzan and Stacey Wright.</li> <li>The men also got into the act. During Men’s League Play at The Ranch, Rob McIntosh and Mitchell Read both recorded holes-in-one. McIntosh’s ace came on No. 14 from 123 yards, while Read’s was on No. 17 from 126 yards.</li> <li>And, as with the Country Club, we’re not done at The Ranch, either, as Jackson Dudley aced No. 3 the following day with a PW from 132 yards on No. 3.</li> <li>Coming in bunches, the Glendale had a pair of holes-in-one: Doug Strang and Barry Sjolie both got the better of No. 13. Strang got his from 168 yards with a 6-iron, while Sjolie’s was from 173 yards with a 7-iron.</li> <li>At Riverside — in the rain during the club’s Two-Man Scramble — Rick Liebrecht didn’t need his partner when he aced the uphill 14th hole from 115 yards with an 8-iron.</li> <li>At Royal Mayfair, Harold Banister took care of No. 4 with a 6-iron from 180 yards.</li> <li>Highlands member Carol Pawlenchuk said it was ‘her turn’ when she went to Radium, B.C., and aced No. 4 from 122 yards with her Callaway Heavenwood.</li> <li>Declan Girard, just nine years old, also went to B.C. to get a hole-in-one.

So for him to go out with a win and on a high note was pretty special.”</p><p>De Graaf’s family even housed Murchison during the City Junior, which was contested at the Edmonton Petroleum Club.</p><p>Murchison, who finished fifth in the Canadian Junior two years ago, opened the two-day tournament with a bogey-free, 5-under 66 — believed to be a record low score for the tournament — and then followed up with a 73 to edge de Graaf, who went 70-73, by four shots.</p><p>Those four shots could be pinpointed to one hole: No. 17.</p><p>“That hole has my number,” de Graaf said of the tough, tight and long dog-leg right Par 4 that he double-bogeyed both days.</p><p>“First round, I was long and put it in the left trees; the second round my anti-left swing went into the right trees.”</p><p>This was Murchison’s second Edmonton Junior victory, his first coming three years ago when he birdied four of his last five holes at Glendale.</p><p>Murchison had the vibes going coming into the tournament. In his practice round, he aced No. 15 from 150 yards with an 8-iron.</p><p>“That gave me a good feeling. My only other hole-in-one was in high school provincials, and I went on to win that tournament, too,” said Murchison.</p><p>Kaitlyn Wingnean, 15, won the overall girl’s title by nine shots — and her 16-and-under division by, gasp, 27 strokes — with rounds of 77-80.</p><p>In other divisions, St. Albert’s Brooke Brezovski, playing up a flight, defeated Sherwood Park’s Alyshia Suleman in a playoff in the girl’s 18-and-under event — both players shooting 166 for the two days — while Brooke’s younger sister, Belle, won the 14-and-under Junior Girls by one shot over the Derrick’s Alexa Wingnean, Kaitlyn’s younger sister.</p><p>Elsewhere, Braden O’Grady won the 16-and-under Junior; Mitchell Shaigec took the 14-and-under Junior; Scott Levey won the 12-and-under boys, and Kalee Seto took the 12-and-under girls.</p><h3>Scene</h3><p>Sturgeon Valley’s Belle Brezovski also won the McLennan Ross Stony Plain stop with an 80.</p><p>And Belvedere’s Jarrett Bossert won his third McLennan Ross event in his last four starts when he took on Black Bull and shot a 75, two better than River Ridge’s Josh Robertson.</p><h3>Noted</h3><ul>\n<li>In addition to Murchison, there were a trillion holes-in-one last week, including three on the same day at the Edmonton Country Club: Karen Holmes on No. 4 from 135 yards and Sheila Marks on No. 13 from 115 yards — both in Ladies Day play — and then Brad Simons continuing the roll with a hole-in-one on No. 18 from 170 yards with a 5-iron.</li> <li>Not done with the Country Club, Mario Mancini also got in on the act with a hole-in-one on the tough 13th hole: 217 yards with a 5-wood.</li> <li>There were also a trio of recent aces at Raven Crest, all on Ladies Day and all on No. 3 from 114 yards: Karen Kreway, Susan Kitzan and Stacey Wright.</li> <li>The men also got into the act. During Men’s League Play at The Ranch, Rob McIntosh and Mitchell Read both recorded holes-in-one. McIntosh’s ace came on No. 14 from 123 yards, while Read’s was on No. 17 from 126 yards.</li> <li>And, as with the Country Club, we’re not done at The Ranch, either, as Jackson Dudley aced No. 3 the following day with a PW from 132 yards on No. 3.</li> <li>Coming in bunches, the Glendale had a pair of holes-in-one: Doug Strang and Barry Sjolie both got the better of No. 13. Strang got his from 168 yards with a 6-iron, while Sjolie’s was from 173 yards with a 7-iron.</li> <li>At Riverside — in the rain during the club’s Two-Man Scramble — Rick Liebrecht didn’t need his partner when he aced the uphill 14th hole from 115 yards with an 8-iron.</li> <li>At Royal Mayfair, Harold Banister took care of No. 4 with a 6-iron from 180 yards.</li> <li>Highlands member Carol Pawlenchuk said it was ‘her turn’ when she went to Radium, B.C., and aced No. 4 from 122 yards with her Callaway Heavenwood.</li> <li>Declan Girard, just nine years old, also went to B.C. to get a hole-in-one. Playing with his granddad at Kokanee Springs, the youngster used a fairway wood from 124 yards on No. 2.</li> </ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>",

Es una buena película que se aleja agradablemente de los <em>blockbusters</em> al uso, cosa remarcada por los tráileres de <em>Vida</em> y <em>Los pasajeros</em> que suelen precederla; pero su tramo central resulta lento y distante. <strong>La estructura narrativa se ve forzada para poder mantener el final,</strong> y pone tanto empeño en establecer la distancia con los alienígenas que es fácil que el espectador la establezca con todos los personajes.</p>\n<p>Aun así, es una buena película y, sobre todo, <strong>una historia ambiciosa que intenta ir más allá de amor y explosiones en el espacio</strong>. Quizás por eso a tanta gente le ha parecido que tiene mucha más profundidad de lo que, en honor a la verdad, ofrece.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uWs5lsWXLbo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<div data-pid=\"48934\" class=\"prh_ml_container\"></div>        </div>",
